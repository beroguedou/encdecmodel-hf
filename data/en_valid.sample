In the meantime , US politicians might have done just about enough to convince debt markets that America ’ s credit is still good .
For that , Americans – and others around the world – should stop pillorying them and give them their due credit .
This month , water once again takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City .
It is an opportune moment : while much of the world ’ s attention has been fixed on issues of energy supply and security , hundreds of millions of people in the developing world continue to see the supply and security of fresh water as equally , if not more , important .
Surveys undertaken by the World Bank in developing countries show that , when poor people are asked to name the three most important concerns they face , “ good health ” is always mentioned .
And a key determinant of whether they will have good health or not is access to clean water .
More than a billion people around the world today do not .
As a result , they are increasingly vulnerable to poor health .
The World Bank estimates that by 2035 , as many as three billion people , almost all of them in developing countries , could live under conditions of severe water stress , especially if they happen to live in Africa , the Middle East , or South Asia .
This will cause obvious hardship , but it will also hold back the economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty .
In Latin America , about 15 % of the population – roughly 76 million people – do not have access to safe water , and 116 million people do not have access to sanitation services .
The figures are worse in Africa and parts of Asia .
This is a situation that few people in rich countries face .
Generally , these countries ’ citizens enjoy services that provide for all water needs , from drinking to irrigation to sanitation .
In addition , other water ##AT##-##AT## related issues , such as the risks posed by flooding , have been reduced to manageable levels .
Rich industrial countries have invested early and heavily in water infrastructure , institutions , and management capacities .
The result , beyond the health benefits for all , has been a proven record of economic growth ; one only has to look at investment in hydropower to see the positive impact of water management projects on many economies .
Granted , rich countries have a certain advantage : they benefit from generally moderate climates , with regular rainfall and relatively low risks of drought and flooding .
Even so , they are not immune to water ##AT##-##AT## related disasters , as Hurricane Katrina ’ s destruction of New Orleans taught us .
But the impact of such events on poor countries is much greater .
Extreme rainfall variations , floods , and droughts can have huge social and economic effects and result in the large ##AT##-##AT## scale loss of life .
The Gulf coast of Mexico and Central American countries has repeatedly experienced such tragedies , with poor communities the most vulnerable and the least able to cope .
Ethiopia and Yemen are equally stark examples .
Ethiopia ’ s development potential is closely tied to seasonal rains , so high rainfall variation , together with lack of infrastructure , has undermined growth and perpetuated poverty .
A single drought can cut growth potential by 10 % over an extended period .
Yemen , for its part , has no perennial surface water ; its citizens depend entirely on rainfall , groundwater , and flash flooding .
To move forward , developing countries need new water infrastructure and better management .
Any approach must be tailored to the circumstances of each country and the needs of its people , but there is no fundamental constraint to designing water development investments that ensure that local communities and the environment gain tangible and early benefits .
In some countries , new water infrastructure may mean canals , pumping stations , and levees .
Still others might need deeper reservoirs , more modern filtration plants , or improved water transport schemes .
These can all potentially be designed to improve and expand water supplies for power generation , irrigation , and household and industrial use , while providing security against droughts and protection from floods .
The key to successful increased investment in water infrastructure is an equally increased investment in water institutions .
Badly managed infrastructure will do little to improve peoples ’ health or support economic growth , so water development and water management must go hand in hand .
Water infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with sound institutions , good governance , great attention to the environment , and an equitable sharing of costs and benefits .
A water investment policy that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and offers basic water security for all will require customized planning and an effective partnership of donor countries , developing country governments , the private sector , and local communities .
Delegates to the World Water Forum will have ample opportunity to forge and / or strengthen these partnerships .
If they succeed , the rewards for the world ’ s poor will be immense .
CHAPEL HILL , NC – Despite recent progress , more than one billion people still lack decent water supplies , and more than two billion go without sanitation services .
But , while we often assume that the benefits of improving water and sanitation systems always outweigh the costs , this is not always true .
Piped water and sanitation networks are expensive .
Consumers in most countries don ’ t realize this , because the true costs are hidden by subsidies .
New research for Copenhagen Consensus reveals that the full cost of piping water to a household is as high as $ 80 per month – more than most households in rich countries pay and far beyond the means of most families in developing countries .
Assuming that the poor use much less water , the monthly cost of conventional network technologies drops to $ 20 – still a significant outlay .
If we calculate the time and energy lost in developing nations to gathering , treating , and storing water , and the health burden caused by a lack of decent drinking water and sanitation , the costs of creating a typical water and sewer network can remain higher than the benefits .
Spending a large amount of money to do a little amount of good is not a sound investment .
Estimates of what people in poor nations are willing to pay for piped water do not exceed the costs for many water and sanitation projects .
Often , they prioritize electrification ahead of running water , even though electricity is not essential for life : whatever the inconvenience , water can be carted home from a vendor or a well , but there is no convenient way to carry electricity .
The health advantages of providing networked water supplies are less dramatic than is often assumed .
There are many ways for pathogens to infect people besides contaminated drinking water .
Piping clean water without improving sanitation can in some cases actually exacerbate the spread of infectious agents .
Just as the conventional wisdom that all networked water and sanitation systems are good investments can be wrong , it can be wrong in assuming that all dams are bad investments .
There are , of course , sound environmental and economic arguments against constructing large dams – and even for decommissioning some .
But countries like Ethiopia have virtually no water storage facilities , great variability in rainfall , and attractive sites for hydroelectric generation .
A single reservoir located in Ethiopia ’ s scarcely inhabited Blue Nile gorge , for example , could produce large amounts of sorely ##AT##-##AT## needed power for Ethiopia , Sudan , and Egypt , mitigate droughts , and lead to improved irrigation .
The costs of a hypothetical project – including construction , resettlement of people living in the dam ’ s way , and carbon emissions – would come to about $ 3.1 billion .
Benefits from power generation , downstream irrigation , carbon offsets , and reduced floods would be worth roughly twice as much .
There are , moreover , alternatives to expensive network infrastructure systems .
A deep borehole with a hand pump can typically service about 300 people , with a monthly cost per household of about $ 2.25 .
The benefits – time saved , more and better quality water , and reduced diarrhea – are likely in many locations to be three times higher than the costs , often exceeding $ 7 per month .
Another sound short ##AT##-##AT## term policy choice is to use devices like bio ##AT##-##AT## sand filters to reduce the health risks associated with consumption of water contaminated with bacteria and viruses .
The filter typically costs a household about $ 1.40 per month , but in many developing countries yields benefits from improved health that are three times higher .
Many developing nations have tackled the sanitation challenge by building subsidized latrines .
However , simply providing access to such facilities can be surprisingly ineffective – a significant number are never used .
A cheaper and more successful approach in South Asia mobilizes communities to achieve environments that are free of open defecation by raising awareness of disease transmission , health costs , and the social benefits of sanitation .
A variety of approaches has been used , from conducting “ walks of shame ” to open ##AT##-##AT## defecation areas to establishing children ’ s brigades to promote the ban .
The community is provided with financial incentives to construct and maintain very basic household latrines .
The costs add up to just $ 0.50 per household , while the benefits from improved health and saved time in many developing countries are worth $ 1.20 .
The international community has committed itself to halving the proportion of people without access to water and sanitation by 2015.The most obvious and comprehensive solution is providing piped water and sanitation to all who lack it .
But , given current progress and high capital costs , this appears overly optimistic .
In the meantime , governments and donors should consider cheaper short ##AT##-##AT## term options .
While the three low ##AT##-##AT## cost water and sanitation interventions discussed here may not always pass a cost ##AT##-##AT## benefit test , they are likely to attract investment in many circumstances , while simultaneously responding to communities ’ preferences .
What is more vital for the future of humanity – and life in general – than water ?
Water abounds in nature , and most of humanity will have lived more than ten millenniums without ever wondering about it .
We draw it , use it , throw it away , most often back into rivers or oceans .
But we could very soon end up not having enough of the fresh water that accounts for just 3 % of all the water available on our planet .
When one considers the fights we are capable of having over oil , one shudders to imagine where a lack of water could lead .
While Latin America seems well endowed , the situation is very different elsewhere .
Europe is nearing its limits , and water scarcity is already a pressing issue in Africa , Central Asia , and China .
Over the last 20 or 30 years we have begun to comprehend what is at stake , owing to initiatives like the World Water Forum , which held its fourth annual meeting in March .
Unfortunately , the Forum is not yet an official body and has no decision ##AT##-##AT## making power .
But providing an arena for thought and debate has brought at least one huge benefit : greater awareness about water issues among the public and policymakers .
Water management is an inherently difficult challenge , and experience counts for a lot .
Practice shows that local levels of government provide the most efficient water management , even if regulations must necessarily be national in scope .
But this is a division of labor that few national governments are ready to accept .
Nor do most states seem prepared to start a real dialogue over water policy with civil society groups .
At one extreme of exclusion , for example , consider that decisions about water management are largely taken by men , though in most of the world it is women who use the water .
Moreover , interference is constant , and inevitable , between the public and the private sectors .
A subtle mix of official regulation and private contracting is required . But not all jurisdictions respond in the same way .
The multiplicity of interlocutors inevitably creates a multiplicity of water systems with vastly unequal levels of efficiency .
Initiatives like the World Water Forums thus inevitably highlight debates about what constitutes good water management , as well as elaborating useful concepts .
One casualty of such debates has been the myth that water is free .
Water has a cost , and someone , either end ##AT##-##AT## users or taxpayers , has to pay it .
It is possible , of course , to envision sharing the costs , but it is no longer possible not to charge for water .
The most recent World Water Forum debated two issues that will confront policymakers in the years ahead .
The first concerns the so ##AT##-##AT## called “ right to water . ”
The urgency of the needs , with a billion people lacking access to drinking water and two billion without proper sewer systems , together with the vast number of diseases that result , underscore the need to recognize such a fundamental human right .
A consensus was reached at the Forum that such a right makes sense only if it is formulated in such a way that particular policymaking entities , be they water companies or local governments , face an affirmative duty to respect this right .
Only the state can be made responsible here .
But the acknowledged responsibility of states in implementing the right to water cannot turn them into the sole paying authority .
The state must be charged with ensuring an effective water system that meets the basic needs of all , but the balance of this system remains to be defined .
These uncertainties , indeed , led the Forum to avoid acknowledging a formal right to water in its final resolution .
The second issue concerned the role of local authorities .
Despite the political and administrative centralization of most of the countries represented at the Forum , there was widespread agreement that the most efficient water systems are managed as close as possible to the resource and its users .
Agreement on this provided a real breakthrough for the future of water policy .
Naturally , conflicts among governments or local authorities and private enterprises resurfaced .
Inevitably , the cruel lack of means was pointed out time and again .
And , unsurprisingly , the lack of solidarity among water haves and have ##AT##-##AT## nots was openly on display at the Forum .
As we grapple with our joint water future , we will face a time of trial and error in finding workable solutions .
But humanity already seems to be making more progress on matters related to drinking water than other global threats , such as climate change .
We should all drink to that .
NEW YORK – Many conflicts are caused or inflamed by water scarcity .
The conflicts from Chad to Darfur , Sudan , to the Ogaden Desert in Ethiopia , to Somalia and its pirates , and across to Yemen , Iraq , Pakistan , and Afghanistan , lie in a great arc of arid lands where water scarcity is leading to failed crops , dying livestock , extreme poverty , and desperation .
Extremist groups like the Taliban find ample recruitment possibilities in such impoverished communities .
Governments lose their legitimacy when they cannot guarantee their populations ’ most basic needs : safe drinking water , staple food crops , and fodder and water for the animal herds on which communities depend for their meager livelihoods .
Politicians , diplomats , and generals in conflict ##AT##-##AT## ridden countries typically treat these crises as they would any other political or military challenge .
They mobilize armies , organize political factions , combat warlords , or try to grapple with religious extremism .
But these responses overlook the underlying challenge of helping communities meet their urgent needs for water , food , and livelihoods .
As a result , the United States and Europe often spend tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars to send troops or bombers to quell uprisings or target “ failed states , ” but do not send one ##AT##-##AT## tenth or even one ##AT##-##AT## hundredth of that amount to address the underlying crises of water scarcity and under ##AT##-##AT## development .
Water problems will not go away by themselves .
On the contrary , they will worsen unless we , as a global community , respond .
A series of recent studies shows how fragile the water balance is for many impoverished and unstable parts of the world .
The United Nations agency UNESCO recently issued The UN World Water Development Report 2009 ; the World Bank issued powerful studies on India ( India ’ s Water Economy : Bracing for a Turbulent Future ) and Pakistan ( Pakistan ’ s Water Economy : Running Dry ) ; and the Asia Society issued an overview of Asia ’ s water crises ( Asia ’ s Next Challenge : Securing the Region ’ s Water Future ) .
These reports tell a similar story .
Water supplies are increasingly under stress in large parts of the world , especially in the world ’ s arid regions .
Rapidly intensifying water scarcity reflects bulging populations , depletion of groundwater , waste and pollution , and the enormous and increasingly dire effects of manmade climate change .
The consequences are harrowing : drought and famine , loss of livelihood , the spread of water ##AT##-##AT## borne diseases , forced migrations , and even open conflict .
Practical solutions will include many components , including better water management , improved technologies to increase the efficiency of water use , and new investments undertaken jointly by governments , the business sector , and civic organizations .
I have seen such solutions in the Millennium Villages in rural Africa , a project in which my colleagues and I are working with poor communities , governments , and businesses to find practical solutions to the challenges of extreme rural poverty .
In Senegal , for example , a world ##AT##-##AT## leading pipe manufacturer , JM Eagle , donated more than 100 kilometers of piping to enable an impoverished community to join forces with the government water agency PEPAM to bring safe water to tens of thousands of people .
The overall project is so cost effective , replicable , and sustainable that JM Eagle and other corporate partners will now undertake similar efforts elsewhere in Africa .
But future water stresses will be widespread , including both rich and poor countries .
The US , for example , encouraged a population boom in its arid southwestern states in recent decades , despite water scarcity that climate change is likely to intensify .
Australia , too , is grappling with serious droughts in the agricultural heartland of the Murray ##AT##-##AT## Darling River basin .
The Mediterranean Basin , including Southern Europe and North Africa is also likely to experience serious drying as a result of climate change .
However , the precise nature of the water crisis will vary , with different pressure points in different regions .
For example , Pakistan , an already arid country , will suffer under the pressures of a rapidly rising population , which has grown from 42 million in 1950 to 184 million in 2010 , and may increase further to 335 million in 2050 , according to the UN ’ s “ medium ” scenario .
Even worse , farmers are now relying on groundwater that is being depleted by over ##AT##-##AT## pumping .
Moreover , the Himalayan glaciers that feed Pakistan ’ s rivers may melt by 2050 , owing to global warming .
Solutions will have to be found at all “ scales , ” meaning that we will need water solutions within individual communities ( as in the piped ##AT##-##AT## water project in Senegal ) , along the length of a river ( even as it crosses national boundaries ) , and globally , for example , to head off the worst effects of global climate change .
Lasting solutions will require partnerships between government , business , and civil society , which can be hard to negotiate and manage , since these different sectors of society often have little or no experience in dealing with each other and may mistrust each other considerably .
Most governments are poorly equipped to deal with serious water challenges .
Water ministries are typically staffed with engineers and generalist civil servants .
Yet lasting solutions to water challenges require a broad range of expert knowledge about climate , ecology , farming , population , engineering , economics , community politics , and local cultures .
Government officials also need the skill and flexibility to work with local communities , private businesses , international organizations , and potential donors .
A crucial next step is to bring together scientific , political , and business leaders from societies that share the problems of water scarcity – for example , Sudan , Pakistan , the US , Australia , Spain , and Mexico – to brainstorm about creative approaches to overcoming them .
Such a gathering would enable information ##AT##-##AT## sharing , which could save lives and economies .
It would also underscore a basic truth : the common challenge of sustainable development should unify a world divided by income , religion , and geography .
New York – Asked in September 2006 whether there was anything wrong with the way American interrogators were handling “ high ##AT##-##AT## value ” prisoners in Guantánamo Bay , and elsewhere , President George W. Bush famously responded : “ We don ’ t torture . ”
The definition of torture is notoriously slippery , but we have known for some time now that the former president was being , shall we say , economical with the truth .
At the very least , American interrogators were in breach of the Geneva Conventions , ratified by the United States , against “ cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment . ”
Tying a person to a board and bringing him to the point of drowning , over and over , or forcing a prisoner – stripped naked and covered in his own excrement – to stand with his hands shackled to the ceiling for days , until his legs swell to twice their normal size , may not have constituted torture in memos prepared by government lawyers , but such practices are surely cruel , inhuman , and degrading .
Barack Obama ’ s first act as America ’ s president was to ban torture immediately .
The question now is how to deal with the past , and specifically with the fact that these acts were not just condoned , but ordered by the highest US officials .
Should the responsible officials , including Bush , be prosecuted for breaking the law ?
Should all the details of what was done be released and publicized ?
Should there be a special commission to investigate ?
Or would it be better , in Obama ’ s words , to “ look to the future , not the past ” ?
In fact , as Obama quickly realized , his preferred response is proving to be impossible , for a refusal to look back will burden the future with greater perils .
Ex ##AT##-##AT## Vice President Dick Cheney has stated on several occasions that he has no regrets about what he likes to call “ enhanced interrogation ” techniques , such as near ##AT##-##AT## drowning , because they “ kept our country safe ” from terrorist attacks . Obama ’ s ban , in his view , leaves the US “ vulnerable . ”
In short , liberal scruples about morality , legality , and international torture conventions are foolish and irresponsible .
The implication is clear : if the US were to be attacked by terrorists again , we will know whom to blame .
The stakes , then , could not be higher in the “ torture debate ” gripping the US .
On one side are Cheney and his allies , who see torture in pragmatic terms ; if a severe threat to collective safety is perceived , even a liberal democracy must get its hands dirty .
Nobody likes to torture , but security is more important than moral scruples , and the laws will simply have to be adjusted or finessed .
On the other side are those who condemn torture as a moral abomination that cannot be allowed under any circumstances .
This , in fact , is also the legal position of those who ratified the Geneva Conventions : “ No exceptional circumstances whatsoever , whether a state of war or a threat of war , internal political instability or any other public emergency , may be invoked as a justification of torture . ”
But these are not the main grounds upon which the torture debate is being fought out in the US today .
For understandable reasons , many defenders of Obama ’ s decision to ban torture are attempting to answer Cheney ’ s pragmatic view with an equally pragmatic counter ##AT##-##AT## narrative .
They argue , contrary to Cheney , that torture is not the best way to keep us safe .
A person in extreme pain will say anything , thus providing unreliable information .
They claim that other , more sophisticated , interrogation techniques are not only more humane ( and legal ) , but also more effective .
To drive this point home to the general public , which , in the US , is still easily persuaded by Cheney ’ s point of view that torture is justified if it saves lives , liberal commentators and politicians have called for a special commission to investigate fully the last administration ’ s record .
This , they believe , will show clearly that torturing is counter ##AT##-##AT## productive .
Not only does it do great harm to the country ’ s image , and the rule of law , but it is likely to cause more , not less , terrorism .
The intellectual and political merits of such an argument are obvious .
The current administration cannot afford to walk into the trap set by Cheney , and be held responsible for another possible terrorist attack just because it abolished torture .
But are these really the proper terms on which this debate should be held ?
If torture is an absolute wrong , whatever the circumstances , the question of its effectiveness is irrelevant .
To hold the debate on those terms threatens to dilute the moral principle .
This leaves the question of why torture should be condemned absolutely , whereas other acts of war , such as bombing , which cause more damage to human life , might be acceptable as inevitable consequences of national defense .
Bombing can , of course , be a war crime if it is used as an act of terror against unarmed people .
But military operations that kill or injure civilians often do not automatically qualify as crimes , as long as deliberately inflicting pain or humiliation on a helpless individual – even if he or she is an enemy – is not the aim .
In the case of torture , that is the aim , which is why it is different from other acts of war .
A prominent American right ##AT##-##AT## wing commentator recently opined that any attempt to hold the torturers , and their masters in the Bush administration , accountable , would make a mockery “ of the efforts of the tough and brave Americans who guard us while we sleep . ”
Aside from the fact that torturing people is not the same as combat , and requires little bravery , this gets it exactly wrong .
After years of torturing people in one of South America ’ s most savage “ dirty wars , ” Brazil ’ s generals decided to stop it , because its institutionalized use was undermining the armed forces ’ discipline and morale .
It was making a mockery of men who should be tough and brave , but had become thugs instead .
A vital distinction between market economies is the degree to which ownership of large firms is separate from a firm &apos;s day ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## day management .
What makes a company &apos;s owners willingly hand over control to professional managers ?
That question is increasingly urgent as wealthy countries ##AT##-##AT## as well as many transition and developing economies ##AT##-##AT## attempt to create the robust securities markets needed to boost investment , productivity , and growth .
Separation of ownership from management and effective securities markets reinforce each other .
The underlying theory is straightforward : if bosses can steal , distant owners will not buy shares .
The formalistic civil ##AT##-##AT## law systems that prevail in continental Europe supposedly provide inadequate protection , so ownership remains concentrated .
By contrast , Anglo Saxon common ##AT##-##AT## law systems empower judges to interpret open ##AT##-##AT## ended fiduciary rules on a case ##AT##-##AT## by ##AT##-##AT## case basis , thereby establishing legal precedents that are binding on managers .
But this is a weak explanation .
Before World War I , Europe &apos;s civil ##AT##-##AT## law countries were developing securities markets as fast as the US and the UK .
Indeed , regulatory agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) arose because common ##AT##-##AT## law fiduciary duties failed to protect distant owners .
Insider trading , for example , was generally legal under the rules governing fiduciary duties in America &apos;s states , which back then played a dominant role .
By contrast , the SEC is a rule ##AT##-##AT## generating institution of the type that civil ##AT##-##AT## law countries like France or Germany would have little difficulty creating if they wished to .
Moreover , fiduciary duties only aspire to prevent insiders from stealing .
They do not control the main costs that shareholders face when they do not manage the company themselves , such as unprofitable expansion , shirking , retention of free cash flow , and empire building .
Unless there is a conflict of interest between a company &apos;s management and its board , owners in common ##AT##-##AT## law countries have no legal recourse when managers &apos; operational or strategic decisions are bad , stupid , or otherwise harmful to shareholders .
Throughout the rich world , institutions that raise the costs to shareholders of turning over control to professional managers play a powerful role in determining outcomes .
But these institutions reflect the political power of social forces , not the differences between civil ##AT##-##AT## law and common ##AT##-##AT## law systems .
In particular , ownership separation in the wealthy continental European nations and the US can be linked with the role of labor inside the firm and within society .
In some nations , labor greatly influences the firm through politics ##AT##-##AT## i.e. , opposing mass lay ##AT##-##AT## offs and resisting restructuring plans that change the nature of the workplace .
Consider a simple scenario : a nation bars firms and owners from laying off employees for economic reasons .
Faced with a no ##AT##-##AT## fire rule , shareholders have reason to be very cautious : if expansion is not profitable , they cannot reduce labor costs .
France , for example , is notorious for forcing foreign firms like Britain &apos;s Marks and Spencer to keep redundant workers on the payroll .
Of course , no nation completely bans lay ##AT##-##AT## offs , but flexibility varies greatly and can be central to profitability .
In a nation like the US , where employees can be fired easily , shareholders have less to fear .
But in a labor ##AT##-##AT## strong society , dominant shareholders ##AT##-##AT## those with the most to lose if expansion goes awry ##AT##-##AT## have reason to keep managers on a short leash . Italy &apos;s Fiat illustrates the problem : even a conservative government seeks to impede downsizing .
A second factor should also make owners want to stay close to the firm if labor is politically strong .
Bargaining over the economic surplus is often open ##AT##-##AT## ended , especially if competition is weak .
Where employees have high bargaining power , the profits pie is constantly up for re ##AT##-##AT## division , both within the firm and at the national level .
If managers are only loosely tied to shareholders , they could more willingly give up a bigger share of the pie to labor .
Similarly , where shareholder interests do not come first , say , in a corporatist system , dominant owners have greater reason to keep financial information private , lest labor use it to press for more favorable terms .
Both considerations support concentrated ownership and work against securities markets .
So , where political and social values strongly favor labor , managers &apos; loyalty to shareholder interests will be weaker .
Managers in such &quot; left &quot; societies are no less technically capable , but their organizational constraints , incentives , and goals are less pro ##AT##-##AT## shareholder .
When forced to cut employment , they are more likely to think that they are destroying lives rather than raising economic efficiency and increasing wealth .
Such societies should have fewer public firms , and narrower or no ownership separation .
So they do .
The OECD has indexed how easy it is to fire an employee in member countries .
Employees enjoy the least protection in the US , and a high degree of protection in Italy , France , and Germany .
The correlation with ownership separation is striking : a sample of the 20 largest firms in each country shows that , whereas 90 % of the US companies have no shareholder with more than a 20 % stake , none of the Italian , French , or German firms have such highly dispersed ownership .
True , with only 16 countries rich enough to be included in the survey , the correlation isn &apos;t perfect .
The United Kingdom is in seventh place in terms of labor ##AT##-##AT## market flexibility , but a higher proportion of its largest companies have widely dispersed ownership than sixth ##AT##-##AT## place Switzerland ##AT##-##AT## and double the share of fifth ##AT##-##AT## place Denmark and fourth ##AT##-##AT## place Australia .
But whatever measures of &quot; political &quot; qualities and ownership separation we use , the index of employment protection appears to be the best predictor of ownership separation in the wealthy West .
More fundamentally , creating the regulatory institutions conducive to ownership separation may be impossible unless a society &apos;s political orientation towards labor and capital is more favorable to capital .
Modern economists have turned Adam Smith into a prophet , just as Communist regimes once deified Karl Marx .
The central tenet they attribute to Smith – that good incentives , regardless of culture , produce good results – has become the great commandment of economics .
Yet that view is a mistaken interpretation of history ( and probably a mistaken reading of Smith ) .
Modern growth came not from better incentives , but from the creation of a new economic culture in societies like England and Scotland .
To get poor societies to grow , we need to change their cultures , not just their institutions and associated incentives , and that requires exposing more people in these societies to life in advanced economies .
Despite the almost universal belief by economists in the primacy of incentives , three features of world history demonstrate the dominance of culture .
In the past , excellent governments – that is , governments that fully incentivized the citizenry – have gone hand in hand with economic stagnation .
The incentives for economic activity are much better in most poor economies , including pre ##AT##-##AT## industrial economies , than in such prosperous and contented economies as Germany or Sweden . The Industrial Revolution itself was the product of changes in basic economic preferences by people in England , not changes in institutions .
For example , the cotton textile industry that developed in Bombay between 1857 and 1947 operated with no employment restrictions , complete security of capital , a stable and efficient legal system , no import or export controls , freedom of entry by entrepreneurs from around the world , and free access to the British market .
Moreover , it had access to some of the world ’ s cheapest capital and labor , in an industry where labor accounted for more than 60 % of manufacturing costs .
Profit rates of only 6 ##AT##-##AT## 8 % in the early twentieth century were enough to induce construction of new mills .
Yet India ’ s textile industry could not compete against Britain ’ s , even though British wages were five times higher .
Incentives alone could not produce growth .
At the opposite end of the spectrum , Scandinavia is notorious among economists for high taxes and government spending .
Wage income is effectively taxed at a whopping rate of 50 ##AT##-##AT## 67 % .
Economic activity is everywhere hedged by rules , regulations , and restrictions .
Yet these are successful economies , producing as much per worker hour as the United States , and growing steadily .
By contrast , in medieval England , typical tax rates on labor and capital income were 1 % or less , and labor and product markets were free and competitive .
Yet there was no economic growth .
Even though assets such as land were completely secure ( in most English villages , land had passed from owner to owner unchallenged through the courts for 800 years or more ) , investors had to be paid real returns of 10 % to hold land .
The Industrial Revolution occurred in a setting where the economy ’ s basic institutional incentives were unchanged for hundreds of years , and , if anything , were getting worse .
Yet , over the centuries , the responses to these incentives gradually strengthened and entrepreneurship took hold .
Profit opportunities from converting common land into private land , which had existed since the Middle Ages , were finally pursued .
Roads that had been largely impassable from neglect for hundreds of years were repaired and improved by local efforts .
The rate of return required on safe investments declined from 10 % to 4 % .
Thus the crucial determinants of wealth and poverty are not differences in incentives , but differences in how people respond to them .
In successful economies , people work hard , accumulate , and innovate even when their incentives are poor .
In failed economies , people work little , save little , and stick with outmoded techniques even when incentives are good .
How can we transform the economic cultures of poor societies to be more like rich ones ?
When workers move from a poor to a rich economy , there is rapid adaptation to the economic mores of the new society .
In the textile industry in the early twentieth century , for example , output per worker hour of Polish workers in New England was four times greater than that of Polish workers using the same machines in Poland .
One reason for illegal migration from the poor to the rich economies is many such migrants ’ ability to adapt to economic life in rich economies .
Migrants accustomed to conditions in successful economies are a potential nucleus for industrialization in poor societies .
But these workers usually choose to remain in rich economies .
A skilled Nigerian immigrant in the US , for example , has more opportunities there than if he returned to Nigeria .
The flow of migrants is all from poor to rich economies , particularly for workers with skills and education .
Thus , the problem is to engineer a sufficient flow of return migration to poor societies by those with exposure to the social conditions of economically successful societies .
Aid to poor societies in the form of programs designed to expose their students and workers to the experience of living and working in the US before returning home will be more effective than trying to make these societies ’ governments and institutions more like those of the advanced economies .
People come first .
The phrase “ Weimar Russia ” first appeared about 13 years ago , at the height of the confrontation between then President Boris Yeltsin and the Supreme Soviet that ended when Yeltsin ’ s tanks shelled the parliament .
The meaning was clear to all : Weimar Russia , like Weimar Germany , signified a weak republic attacked from within by nationalists yearning to restore authoritarian ways .
In the late 1990 ’ s and the early years of this decade , the problems that incited fears of a dysfunctional state seemed to fade .
But over the past 18 months , the specter of Weimar has once again begun to haunt Russia .
If taken to extremes , Russian society ’ s response to its wrenching modernization could degenerate into a nationalist revolution led by xenophobes .
A different and healthy conservative response is possible if the tattered remnants of old threads , torn apart in the course of postcommunist modernization , can reconnect and grow together in a new way .
The problem is that everyone writes history in their own manner , and that there are no scales that can fix the precise point at which the remedy of unifying patriotism turns into the lethal poison of rabid nationalism .
Weimar Germany blindly poisoned itself .
In the period from 1991 to 1993 , nationalism was on the rise because Yeltsin ’ s infant democracy seemed weak , with the country in the throes of a deep economic crisis , as well as an acute confrontation between different branches of government .
But what explains today ’ s resurgence of nationalism , when the regime and economy are strong , and all branches of government appear to operate in total unity ?
Indeed , there are no practical reasons for Russia ’ s current system of governance to fall into crisis ( although such reasons may emerge in the event of an economic downturn ) .
But there is another reason , no less important , that concerns morals and ideology .
Challenges to established political authority have been chilled , fairly effectively , by means of state ##AT##-##AT## sponsored patriotism .
But the virus of nationalism has survived and multiplied .
Opinion polls , for example , indicate that 50 % of Russians support the slogan “ Russia for Russians . ”
Moreover , nationalism has spread from the streets into the elite .
Nationalist statements that would have been confined to the extremist newspaper Den in the early 1990 ’ s are now considered normal , “ centrist , ” even commonplace .
Today ’ s hardcore Russian nationalists consider Putin ’ s regime too soft , too pragmatic , too reasonable – in their language , “ weak and indecisive . ”
They loathe it for its “ surrender ” in Ukraine to the “ Orange Revolution , ” and they condemn the decision to give land along Siberia ’ s Amur River to China .
The “ Putin Center ” can be displaced .
Recall that Russia ’ s pro ##AT##-##AT## Western liberals , ascendant a decade ago , have been relegated to the ideological fringe , with the very word “ democrat ” ( let alone “ pro ##AT##-##AT## West ” ) now a term of abuse .
Fortunately , there is no sign yet ( not even on the horizon ) of a charismatic leader capable of forging the scattered energies of national ##AT##-##AT## socialist grievances into a critical mass of hatred and “ national revival . ”
Stalin ’ s ghost is no substitute for a real live leader ; he will never leap out of his portraits , no matter how often they are waved .
Moreover , times have changed .
For example , no one even mentions the idea of introducing a dictatorship , abolishing elections , and so on .
No matter how harshly Russia ’ s “ democrats ” are abused , the word “ democracy ” remains a sacred cow .
Instead , a populist ##AT##-##AT## nationalist revolution might resemble the attempt to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991 , or a Russian version of Ukraine ’ s Orange Revolution .
It might be some sort of “ democratic nationalist revolution ” – spontaneous , and not made by any one political party but by a popular mass movement .
It would be anti ##AT##-##AT## bureaucrat , anti ##AT##-##AT## oligarch , anti ##AT##-##AT## West , and staunchly pro ##AT##-##AT## nationalist .
These are the key ingredients in the nationalist stew that seems to appeal to Russians nowadays .
Judging by Putin ’ s most recent address to parliament , his regime is fully aware of the danger posed by populist nationalists .
It is likely that the regime will attempt to counter this eruption of nationalism while maintaining its strong statist rhetoric .
But , in order to defeat the far right , Putin ’ s regime will be forced to take its stand on more or less liberal ideological grounds .
This won ’ t be easy for a regime based on the twin pillars of bureaucracy and the security apparatus .
What liberals should do in these circumstances is obvious : support Putin ’ s regime insofar as it maintains the foundation and institutions of a liberal order .
The populist nationalists , because they reject these fundamentals , are the unremitting political antagonists of all liberals .
Yet an alliance with the nationalists against Putin currently tempts many Russian liberals .
Indeed , the most popular tactic among liberals nowadays is to unite with all opponents of the regime .
That scheme is both absurd and dangerous .
After all , the word “ Weimar ” draws its infamy from the pact with the devil that German conservatives and royalists made by backing Hitler .
Two diametrically opposed scenarios exist for what will happen to global real interest rates over the next generation .
Those who predict generally low interest rates over the next generation point to rapid growth of productivity and potential output in the world economy .
According to this view , the principal problem faced by central banks will not be restraining demand as it shoots above potential , but boosting demand as it lags behind potential .
They point to the fact that the world &apos;s major central banks - the Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , and the Bank of Japan - have so firmly established their anti ##AT##-##AT## inflation credibility that the inflation risk premium has been wrung out of interest rates .
Believers in low interest rates also emphasize shifts in income distribution in the United States away from labor and toward capital , which have greatly boosted firms &apos; resources to finance investment internally and reduced their dependence on capital markets .
They point to rapid technological progress , which has boosted output from new and old capital investments .
With competition strong across the economy , they say that we can look forward to a generation of relatively high asset prices and relatively low real interest rates worldwide .
By contrast , those who predict generally high real interest rates over the next generation point to low savings rates in the US , high spending driven by demographic burdens in Europe , and feckless governments running chronic deficits and unsustainable fiscal policies .
Imagine a bunch of irresponsible Bush ##AT##-##AT## like administrations making fiscal policy , forever .
They also cite investment opportunities in emerging markets , and make the obvious point that if China and India stay on track , their economies &apos; relative weight in the world will double in the next decade or so , as rapid real growth is accompanied by appreciation in their real exchange rates .
Sooner or later , the Chinese and Indian central banks &apos; desire to hold down exchange rates to boost exports and their rich citizens &apos; desire to keep their money in accounts at Bank of America will be offset by the sheer magnitude of investment opportunities .
In this scenario , bond prices in post ##AT##-##AT## industrial countries are heading for a serious fall - as are real estate prices in California , New York , and London .
What , then , is an economist to do ?
One could emulate J.P. Morgan , whose standard response to questions about stock prices , bond prices , and interest rates was to say simply , &quot; The market will fluctuate . &quot;
Another alternative is to recall the late Rudi Dornbusch , who taught that any economist who forecasts interest rates based on fundamentals is a fool , because fundamentals are complex and unstable , shifting suddenly and substantially .
Even if an economist correctly understands fundamentals , Dornbusch warned , that doesn &apos;t mean that markets do .
In forecasting interest rates one is engaged not in examining fundamentals , but in predicting what average market opinion expects average market opinion about fundamentals to be .
But Rudi never followed his own advice .
So let me place my bet - which I think is only 60 % likely - and say that my best guess is that world real interest rates will be high over the next generation , and that current bond prices ( and real estate prices ) are not sustainable .
Four features of modern politics in the world &apos;s post ##AT##-##AT## industrial core lead me to this conclusion :
· In the US , the collapse of &quot; grownup &quot; Republicans in Congress - the extraordinary failure of fiscal conservatives to mount any effective opposition to the Bush administration &apos;s renewed destabilization of American government finances .
The deficit orgy of the Reagan era is looking less like a freak political accident and more like a structural feature of Republican Party governance - what the modern Republican governing coalition tends to do whenever it gains power ;
· The parallel collapse of a grownup Republican presence in the executive branch .
As Ron Suskind reports in his recent biography of Bush &apos;s first Treasury Secretary , Paul O &apos;Neill , former Bush Budget Director Mitch Daniels once whispered to himself at the end of a disastrous meeting , &quot; Not a typical Republican package .
Definitely not . &quot;
But Daniels decided he would rather run for office in Indiana than take a stand in support of sound fiscal finance ;
· The failure of Western European governments to even begin to think about how to address the coming fiscal crisis of the social ##AT##-##AT## insurance state as a result of their aging populations ;
· The inability of Western European governments to enact sufficiently bold liberalizing reforms to create the possibility of full employment , together with the failure of western European monetary policy to be sufficiently stimulative to create the reality of full employment .
The arguments for low interest rates seem to me to require a degree of government competence that is unlikely , given political parties &apos; current positions and the existing structure of the institutions that make fiscal policy .
I hope to be surprised .
I hope to see governments in Western Europe and the US face up to their responsibilities and conduct sensible , sustainable fiscal policies .
But that is my hope , not my forecast .
In January , the European Union expanded eastward once again .
Following the “ Big Bang ” enlargement of 2004 , which added 75 million new EU citizens , the accession of Romania and Bulgaria has added 30 million more . What does this mean for the labour markets of Western Europe ?
Politicians tend to argue that , although some plumbers migrate to the West and companies relocate to the East , the West will enjoy more jobs in net terms due to the likely expansion of its exports .
That reasoning is familiar , but is it correct ?
One thing is certain : enlargement has confronted Western Europe with extremely stiff wage competition .
Whereas an employee in the old EU ’ s manufacturing sector on average earns € 26.09 per hour , in Romania the average is € 1.60 and in Bulgaria a mere € 1.39 .
The view that eastward enlargement will create jobs in the West assumes that East European low ##AT##-##AT## wage workers will complement , and boost demand for , West European workers .
In fact , this is partly the case .
West European engineers are needed to design world ##AT##-##AT## class products to be manufactured by East European workers , while people with managerial skills can be sure that their abilities will be needed to integrate the EU ’ s newest workers into the European economy .
But for the great majority of workers who have only their normal labor to sell , East European employees are actually substitutes , not complements .
They find themselves confronted by low ##AT##-##AT## wage competition from people who have similar skills and ambitions , and are consequently likely to lose ground from enlargement .
According to empirical studies , the group of losers ranges from low ##AT##-##AT## skilled to skilled workers with a completed educational training .
The implications for the labor market are clear : for the highly qualified in the West European workforce , eastern enlargement will lead to an increase in labor demand ; for all others , it will mean a decrease .
Due to a fundamental asymmetry in the flexibility of wages this will lead to a net decline of employment . Since unemployment is low among the more highly qualified , higher demand for their services will lead to an increase in wages rather than an increase in employment .
For the less qualified in Western Europe , a decrease in employment will be inevitable , because the scope for wage fluctuation is limited by collective agreements and by the minimum ##AT##-##AT## wage levels that the welfare state sets through wage ##AT##-##AT## replacement benefits and legal minimum wages .
Wage inflexibility , combined with the substitution effect exerted on the great majority of West European workers implies that eastern enlargement will cause a net loss of jobs in Western Europe , if the labor market remains as inflexible as it now is .
To be sure , eastern enlargement is leading to an increase in West European exports , because more markets have been opened in which western firms can sell their products .
However , if exports increase , the factors of production – namely capital , qualified workers , and unskilled workers – must be diverted from other sectors of the economy , and this leads to a loss of jobs there .
Since export goods are considerably more capital and knowledge ##AT##-##AT## intensive in their production than other goods , the structural change will even reduce the net demand for unskilled labour : capital and talents that move away from the other sectors will not take all the unskilled workers with them .
The shrinking sectors include the labour ##AT##-##AT## intensive upstream stages of the production process , where jobs have been outsourced to other countries – a phenomenon that is neither apparent to customers nor reflected in statistics on foreign direct investment .
Moreover , while it is often conceded that jobs can be lost via foreign direct investment , much more important are financial capital exports , that is , the loans that enable foreign firms to create jobs on their own turf .
Consider Germany , which in 2006 exported capital worth € 108 billion , only € 25 billion of which was for direct investments , whereas net domestic investment in all sectors combined was only € 75 billion .
Part of this capital export flowed to the new EU members in Eastern Europe , which enjoyed , relative to their size , gigantic capital imports .
Considering all these factors , the assertion that the EU ’ s eastward enlargement will lead to net job creation in Western Europe appears to be nothing more than empty politically correct rhetoric .
Western European wages are far too rigid for the benefits of competition and sectoral change to be shared by a majority of workers .
Recent statements from some American leaders and NATO representatives give the impression that not only Islamic and other radicals , but also quite civilized figures , are losing their grasp of reality and have begun acting irrationally .
The world is becoming an increasingly difficult place to predict and manage , especially for those who are accustomed to being in charge .
The mistakes of the past decade will exact a very high price .
Three countries – Pakistan , India , and North Korea – have been allowed to develop nuclear weapons , proving that there are no remaining political or moral arguments against nuclear proliferation , only air strikes or bribery .
Instead of a dialogue of civilizations and support for modernist forces in the Middle East , preference has been given to an almost opposite course of action .
The invasion of Iraq destroyed a very unpleasant tyranny , but it has inspired a wave of hatred towards the West , even among those who despised Saddam , and has divided the West against itself .
Indeed , anti ##AT##-##AT## American coalitions have appeared not only in the Middle East but also in Latin America , while some Western politicians have apparently sought to aggravate relationships with Russia and China in order to restore transatlantic solidarity and further weaken Europe .
For example , there is talk of installing anti ##AT##-##AT## missile defense systems in Poland in proximity to the Russian border , supposedly to prevent terrorist missile strikes , which by definition cannot reach Poland .
There is also talk of NATO accession by Australia , South Korea , Japan , and New Zealand .
None of these countries needs NATO , but the smell of PATO , CENTO , SEATO , and other long forgotten pacts and pseudo pacts is again in the air .
Similarly , NATO ’ s Parliamentary Assembly has announced preparations for NATO accession by such countries as Croatia , Macedonia , and even Albania , all of which fall short of the alliance ’ s traditional membership criteria .
More importantly , the United States and Ukraine are talking seriously about Ukraine ’ s rapid accession to NATO , by 2008 .
NATO expansion is sought by those in Ukraine who are not sure of themselves and the viability of the Ukrainian state , are afraid of a competitive Russia , and would like to bind their state , militarily and politically , to the US .
But this betrays a profound lack of understanding of the consequences of Ukraine ’ s accession to NATO .
It is unlikely , for example , that Ukraine could remain without a demarcated border with Russia .
However , if a real border is to be created – it currently exists only on paper and provides income for corrupt customs officials – huge problems will arise .
Every hill will become strategic , and every gully will become historic .
They will be fought for , and bloodshed is not hard to imagine .
Millions of families will be divided , and millions of people who work on the other side of the border may lose their jobs .
Do those who support NATO ’ s expansion to Ukraine understand this ?
Some may , but it seems that the majority simply do not recall or consider the lessons of recent history .
Of course , Russia is not Serbia .
It will survive NATO ’ s further enlargement , although it will be weakened temporarily and pushed into anti ##AT##-##AT## Western alliances .
Many Russian officials will lose patience with Russia ’ s remaining a status ##AT##-##AT## quo power , and one hopes that they will not seek confrontation .
Immeasurably larger damage will be done to Ukraine : it will lose a vital partner , one that perhaps has not always been ideal , but that nonetheless has never inflicted any damage and has never allied with other countries against it .
But the West would also suffer , for a new “ instability arch ” along the Russian ##AT##-##AT## Ukrainian border would kill the idea of establishing an alliance of the world ’ s large powers against new threats and revive rivalry between blocs of a different kind .
If this happens , everyone will lose – apart from terrorists and radicals of every stripe .
Nobody can afford so seriously dangerous an expansion of NATO into Ukraine .
Let us hope , therefore , that reason – and the instinct of self ##AT##-##AT## preservation – will ultimately prevail .
The bloody end to the schoolhouse hostage crisis in North Ossetia , and recent clashes in Georgia between government troops and separatist forces , have put the troubled Black Sea region on the front pages of newspapers once again .
This rising violence is also a wake ##AT##-##AT## up call for the West , highlighting the need for a new Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic strategy in a vitally important region that lies at the crossroads of Europe , Eurasia , and the Middle East .
Indeed , the Black Sea region is the Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic community &apos;s eastern frontier with the wider Middle East .
With Afghanistan , Iraq , and Iran topping the list of strategic challenges facing the West , anchoring democracy and security in these new borderlands of the Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic community has become imperative for both the United States and the EU .
Moreover , success here can provide lessons in how to facilitate the daunting process of reform and modernization in the wider Middle East .
Georgia &apos;s &quot; Rose Revolution &quot; last winter demonstrated that the will to implement radical reform now exists .
For the first time , a country in the region is matching its aspirations with the concrete steps needed to become a viable candidate for eventual membership in Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic institutions .
A visitor to Georgia &apos;s capital , Tbilisi , now sees the same level of determination to join the West that existed a decade ago in the Baltic states .
America and Europe share an interest in the success of these efforts , particularly as they seek to diversify energy supplies away from Saudi Arabian and Persian Gulf oil .
The Black Sea is poised to become a key conduit for non ##AT##-##AT## OPEC , non ##AT##-##AT## Gulf oil and natural gas flowing into European markets and beyond .
The Black Sea region &apos;s long ##AT##-##AT## term stability and integration with the West is thus critically important to the long ##AT##-##AT## term energy security strategy of EU and NATO members .
Anchoring these countries to the West will not be easy . Whether the end result is better relations or full integration of these countries into the EU and NATO is an open question .
But both organizations need to reach out to these countries , a process that should be seen as the next phase in completing the wider Europe .
What should a new bold yet realistic EU and NATO outreach strategy for the Black Sea region look like ?
Clearly , the region &apos;s countries are weaker and further behind previous candidates for Western integration .
But the good news is that the EU and NATO are much better positioned to develop an ambitious strategy than they were vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis Central and Eastern Europe a decade ago .
If the EU and NATO decide to launch a bold outreach strategy for the region , they will be able to draw on existing tools , conceptual talent , and practical experience .
For example , NATO already has three members - Bulgaria , Romania , and Turkey - bordering the Black Sea .
As for the EU , the candidacies of Romania and Bulgaria need to be concluded successfully , together with the issue of Turkey &apos;s membership aspirations .
An EU that includes Sofia and Bucharest , and that is on track with Ankara , will be well positioned to engage the wider region .
The EU also needs to put meat on the bones of its new Neighborhood Policy , while NATO must apply new mechanisms for strengthening ties with the region .
As opposed to a 100- or 200 ##AT##-##AT## meter sprint , both organizations need to think more in terms of a much longer race , perhaps a marathon .
If countries in the region embrace the idea , a network of current EU and NATO members could step forward with projects and assistance aimed at promoting a Black Sea identity and community .
Recent events in Georgia remind us that resolving the region &apos;s &quot; frozen conflicts &quot; - i.e. , those in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , of Transdneistria in Moldova , and Nagorno ##AT##-##AT## Karabakh in Azerbaijan - must be a priority .
In reality , these conflicts are not frozen ; they are festering wounds that breed corruption and organized crime .
They inhibit democratization and incite instability .
While these conflicts involve historical grievances , outside actors - particularly Russia - contribute to their lack of resolution , which is essential for successful reform .
So far , neither America nor Europe has made these conflicts a top priority .
Resolving these semi ##AT##-##AT## dormant wars requires stepped ##AT##-##AT## up political involvement , economic engagement , and a willingness to provide Western peacekeeping forces and monitors if and when they are needed .
But the long ##AT##-##AT## term peace and stability needed to advance economic and political reform in the region will also require either a change in Russian behavior or a reduction in Russian influence .
The experience of the last decade suggests that a policy of engaging the Kremlin intensely while protecting fundamental Western interests may be the best way to proceed .
Developing a new Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic strategy for the Black Sea region must start with the democracies of North America and Europe recognizing their moral and political stake in the outcome .
Projecting stability and security in these countries is the next logical step in building a Europe &quot; whole and free &quot; and securing the Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic community &apos;s eastern frontier with the Middle East .
This task will be as important over the next decade as integrating Central and Eastern Europe into the West was in the 1990 &apos;s .
As America ’ s primaries move beyond Iowa and New Hampshire , it is simply impossible to predict who will be the Democratic and Republican nominees , much less who will become the 44th president of the United States .
But it is not too soon to address the question of what effect US foreign policy is having on the campaign and what it reveals about how Americans see the world .
To the surprise of many seasoned observers , foreign policy is having only a modest impact on voters .
This is unexpected , because only six months ago the war in Iraq dominated the political landscape .
Although Iraq still matters a lot to Americans , its importance for determining how they vote has receded , partly because US casualties there are markedly down as the security situation appears to be gradually improving .
As a result , there is considerably less public pressure to do something dramatically different .
Foreign policy has also become less salient than it was only months ago as the chance of war between the US and Iran has diminished , following the recently published National Intelligence Estimate on Iran ’ s nuclear program .
The judgment by America ’ s intelligence community that Iran has suspended its nuclear weapon development program – and , more importantly , that its large ##AT##-##AT## scale uranium enrichment capacity is likely years away – postpones the day when a US president may have to decide between living with or attacking a nuclear Iran .
A third reason for the modest impact of international issues on voters ’ choice of the next president is another surprising development : more agreement between and among the leading candidates than meets the eye .
There is something of a consensus , for example , emerging around the notion that the US should remain in Iraq for some time to come , albeit with a reduced level of military forces .
There is also widespread acknowledgement that the US must do more both at home and diplomatically to address global climate change ; that the US must work with its European allies to prevent Afghanistan from slipping back into anarchy ; and that the US must take the strongest possible stand against terrorism and those who would support it in any way . No major candidate is advocating anything remotely resembling isolationism .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , the deterioration of America ’ s economy is now overshadowing foreign policy .
The greatest crisis facing many Americans is their increasing inability to meet their monthly mortgage payments .
Recession , job loss , and expensive oil , not war , is what Americans fear most for 2008 .
This is not to suggest that foreign policy is absent from the campaign .
Along with the economy , a dominant issue on the political agenda – and one that has affected Republican politics in particular – is immigration .
There is growing opposition to illegal entry , but no consensus about what to do about those who have been in the country illegally for years or those who want to come to the US in the future .
It is also possible to see in the politics of both parties mounting concern about globalization .
With tougher economic times inevitably come tougher positions toward foreign competition and outsourcing .
There may also be latent concern about foreign policy in the attention being given to the quantity and quality of candidates ’ relevant experience .
A desire for “ change ” is a common refrain of the American debate , but it is far from the only one .
Renewed interest in foreign policy and the rest of the world could surface if there were a dramatic overseas development .
We saw this a few weeks ago , when former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated .
Democratic and Republican candidates alike were called upon to explain what they would be prepared to do if there were an opportunity to capture Osama Bin Laden or a need to secure Pakistan ’ s nuclear weapons .
Likewise , Iraq could return to center stage if the positive momentum of recent months were suddenly reversed , perhaps following a new outbreak of violence between the country ’ s Sunnis and Shia .
The US and Iran could go to war not over nuclear issues but because of reckless behavior by the Revolutionary Guards ( as occurred recently in the Strait of Hormuz ) , with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad possibly seeking to provoke a crisis in order to distract domestic attention from his economic failures .
Order in Pakistan could break down irretrievably .
A terrorist attack could remind Americans of their fundamental vulnerability .
The possibilities are endless .
America ’ s next president will face a host of pressing and difficult foreign policy challenges – and how he or she responds will affect not only the US , but the entire world .
In the meantime , though , foreign policy will have only an indirect influence on Americans ’ choice .
Many places around the world have been in a housing boom since the late 1990 ’ s .
As I argued last year , in the second edition of my book Irrational Exuberance , the boom is rooted in speculative investment by ordinary homebuyers , fueled substantially by the worldwide perception that capitalism has triumphed , and that all people must look out for themselves by acquiring property .
Convinced that private ownership has become essential to smart living , buyers bid up home prices .
Moreover , the fear that one must get in on the boom before it is too late often drives people to bid up home prices faster now .
This certainly seems to be the market psychology in China and India , where rapidly rising incomes and newly successful people are widely expected to put pressure on markets for land , real estate , and construction materials .
Real estate booms have been going on in these countries ’ major cities for years .
In China , despite some signs of weakness – the Shanghai market is down , for example – price growth is still robust in much of the country .
But the boom generated by such beliefs cannot go on forever , because prices can ’ t go up forever , and there are already signs of a hard landing .
In the United States , newspapers and magazines are trumpeting reports in the last few months that the decade ##AT##-##AT## long boom in home prices may be at an end , and that the bubble may be bursting .
The psychology has suddenly changed , creating widespread fear of sharp drops in US home prices .
The new futures market for single ##AT##-##AT## family homes at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( which I helped establish last May with our firm MacroMarkets LLC ) is predicting that by next August prices will fall between 6 % and 8 % in all ten US cities traded .
If home prices crash in the US , the bastion of capitalism , could it destroy confidence and end the boom in other countries ?
If so , could a worldwide recession follow ?
This scenario is a distinct possibility , although there are reasons to be skeptical .
Most importantly , the ultimate sources of the housing boom – the beliefs about capitalism and future economic growth – seem solidly entrenched .
The downward price trend in the US market , for example , does not seem to reflect underlying changes in long ##AT##-##AT## run economic confidence .
The survey that Karl Case and I conducted in May and June of this year , under the auspices of the Yale School of Management , shows sharp declines in short ##AT##-##AT## term expectations for home prices in the US , but relatively little change in long ##AT##-##AT## term expectations .
Most people still believe that housing is a great long ##AT##-##AT## term investment .
Maybe real estate prices are unlikely to fall to pre ##AT##-##AT## boom levels because the fundamental change in perceptions concerning capitalism ’ s triumph will be longstanding .
Changes in people ’ s fundamental ways of thinking are not easily reversed .
Nor , therefore , is their interest in housing as a major speculative investment asset likely to change .
The transformation in investors ’ beliefs is striking .
Before the real estate boom of the late 1970 ’ s , hardly anyone was worried about rising home prices .
A search of old newspapers finds surprisingly few articles about the outlook for home prices .
Those that did appear generally seem to be based on the assumption that minor fluctuations in construction costs , not massive market swings , drove the modest home price movements that they noted .
Indeed , hardly anything interesting about home prices was ever reported at all , aside from an occasional comment in an article about something else .
For example , an article in The Times of London in 1970 argued that rising home prices reflected the switch to a new British Standard Time ( imposed as a three ##AT##-##AT## year experiment in 1968 to facilitate commerce with Western Europe by putting Britain in the same time zone ) .
The article claimed that the change raised costs by forcing British construction workers to perform more of their jobs in relative darkness .
Speculative investment behavior was hardly an issue in those rare instances in which home prices were discussed .
To understand the nature of the subsequent shift , consider that it is hard to find anyone today who worries that automobile prices will soar because rising demand in China and India for steel and other materials will push automobile prices out of reach in the future .
Though a small group of collectors invests speculatively in antique or specialty cars , the idea of speculating in automobiles just is not in the public consciousness .
That is how it was with housing until the late 1970 ’ s .
Now that we think differently about real estate , we will never be the same again .
But , of course , housing prices can only rise so fast .
High and rapidly rising home prices tend to stimulate new housing supply , which in turn tends to undermine prices .
Over a period of years , as people see how much new supply there is , they may begin to revise their view that homes are such a terrific investment , causing a gradual , but eventually significant , drop in home prices .
Indeed , while changes in fundamental perceptions may not occur easily or fast , they should never be ruled out .
Urban land prices in major Japanese cities have steadily dropped over much of the period since 1991 , as the enormous faith in the miraculous powers of Japanese capitalism gradually faded .
The same kind of erosion in home prices could occur in many cities around the world .
All that is required is that growth in housing supply eventually outstrips investors ’ faith in capitalism to sustain faster growth in demand .
The forced resignation of Bolivia &apos;s President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada , following a month of violent demonstrations , marks a tragic milestone whose meaning extends far beyond his impoverished country .
Bolivia &apos;s civil and political breakdown provides another vivid example of the poverty of US foreign policy .
Sánchez de Lozada is one of Latin America &apos;s true heroes , a leader who helped usher in democracy and modest--if fragile--economic growth during the past 20 years , including two terms as president .
Yet now he has fled Bolivia in fear for his life .
American arrogance and neglect played a big part in this stunning reversal .
Virtually all of South America has been in deep economic malaise of late , with high unemployment , rising poverty , and growing social unrest .
Argentina endured economic collapse and four failed presidencies during the past three years .
Brazil is battling recession and rising unemployment .
Political systems have fallen apart in Peru , Ecuador , and Venezuela .
Colombia is in open civil war .
As a landlocked Andean country , Bolivia suffers its own special distress .
Its transport costs are among the highest in the world , reflecting mountainous terrain and international trade routes that must cross political boundaries and depend on foreign ports .
This discourages inward investment and strains relations with coastal neighbors .
Indeed , the precipitating factor in Bolivia &apos;s collapse was a plan to export natural gas to the US through archrival Chile , a country deeply resented since the War of the Pacific in the late 19 th century , which rendered Bolivia landlocked .
Sánchez de Lozada spoke of the gas exports as a means for investing in health , education , and economic development .
But Bolivia &apos;s impoverished population had been ripped off too many times and feared , understandably , that gas revenues would accrue to foreigners or to Bolivia &apos;s own rich .
Yet the spark in Bolivia was more than a regional economic crisis amplified by bad geography and a distrusted gas deal .
Just as US presidents treat the Middle East as America &apos;s gasoline station , they treat the Andean countries not as home to 130 million poor and struggling people , but , first and foremost , as suppliers of cocaine .
Bolivia &apos;s peasant coca cultivators are viewed not as indigenous people trying to survive in a region mostly without jobs , but as drug traffickers .
America &apos;s domestic public health problem is seen as an Andean ##AT##-##AT## wide plot to be suppressed with military force , exacerbating violence throughout the region .
When the Bolivian government before Sánchez de Lozada faced US demands to destroy the coca crop , I advised that it insist on adequate aid to finance economic development .
Desperate for any assistance at all , Bolivia &apos;s governments ultimately uprooted thousands of hectares of peasant crops--and got almost nothing in return but a lot of phony slogans about alternative development .
Not surprisingly , the 2002 elections turned on the explosive coca eradication issue .
Evo Morales , the leader of the coca growers &apos; federation , came within a whisker of winning the presidency , helped by the US ambassador &apos;s warning that his election would be seen as hostile to America .
That &quot; endorsement &quot; by itself was almost enough to give Morales the presidency .
In the event , it put him into the leadership of the insurrection that toppled Sánchez de Lozada .
The main surprise is that Sánchez de Lozada lasted as long as he did .
He inherited an economic , political , and social crisis as deep as any in the world , and he warned President Bush last year that extreme poverty and widening ethnic divisions could incite insurrection .
Bush literally laughed in his face , saying not to worry , that he , too , faced political pressures .
Sánchez de Lozada pressed again for US financial help-- $ 150 million--but Bush ushered him from the Oval Office with a pat on the back .
Sánchez de Lozada returned to Bolivia empty ##AT##-##AT## handed , except for instructions from the IMF to implement austerity measures in accordance with the dictates of the US Treasury .
The measures led to a police strike , followed by a popular insurrection and an assassination attempt .
IMF officials deny responsibility for the upheaval , but have failed to provide an honest public appraisal of Bolivia &apos;s urgent financial needs .
Even after a failed assassination attempt , the US again brushed off requests for aid .
The US adventure in Iraq has squandered $ 150 billion over two years , while Bolivia received $ 10 million--that &apos;s right , $ 10 million--in &quot; emergency &quot; help , a fifteenth or less of what was realistically needed to ease the intense economic crisis and help displaced peasants .
Now US interests in Bolivia lie in shambles : the country seethes with violence , and coca production is likely to soar .
American foreign policy is brain dead .
Even as Sánchez de Lozada was hounded from office on the streets of La Paz as an American lackey , the Bush administration showed no interest or support .
An obsessive US administration , led by a President who reportedly believes that he is on a holy mission to fight terror in the Middle East , pays no attention to the rest of the world .
Woe to any poor country that follows US dictates .
A narrow ##AT##-##AT## minded and violent US administration has lost interest even in helping its friends .
NEW YORK – Just when it seemed that things couldn ’ t get worse , it appears that they have .
Even some of the ostensibly “ responsible ” members of the eurozone are facing higher interest rates .
Economists on both sides of the Atlantic are now discussing not just whether the euro will survive , but how to ensure that its demise causes the least turmoil possible .
It is increasingly evident that Europe ’ s political leaders , for all their commitment to the euro ’ s survival , do not have a good grasp of what is required to make the single currency work .
The prevailing view when the euro was established was that all that was required was fiscal discipline – no country ’ s fiscal deficit or public debt , relative to GDP , should be too large .
But Ireland and Spain had budget surpluses and low debt before the crisis , which quickly turned into large deficits and high debt .
So now European leaders say that it is the current ##AT##-##AT## account deficits of the eurozone ’ s member countries that must be kept in check .
In that case , it seems curious that , as the crisis continues , the safe haven for global investors is the United States , which has had an enormous current ##AT##-##AT## account deficit for years .
So , how will the European Union distinguish between “ good ” current ##AT##-##AT## account deficits – a government creates a favorable business climate , generating inflows of foreign direct investment – &amp; # 160 ; and “ bad ” current ##AT##-##AT## account deficits ?
Preventing bad current ##AT##-##AT## account deficits would require far greater intervention in the private sector than the neoliberal and single ##AT##-##AT## market doctrines that were fashionable at the euro ’ s founding would imply .
In Spain , for example , money flowed into the private sector from private banks .
Should such irrational exuberance force the government , willy ##AT##-##AT## nilly , to curtail public investment ?
Does this mean that government must decide which capital flows – say into real ##AT##-##AT## estate investment , for example – are bad , and so must be taxed or otherwise curbed ?
To me , this makes sense , but such policies should be anathema to the EU ’ s free ##AT##-##AT## market advocates .
The quest for a clear , simple answer recalls the discussions that have followed financial crises around the world .
After each crisis , an explanation emerges , which the next crisis shows to be wrong , or at least inadequate .
The 1980 ’ s Latin American crisis was caused by excessive borrowing ; but that could not explain Mexico ’ s 1994 crisis , so it was attributed to under ##AT##-##AT## saving .
Then came East Asia , which had high savings rates , so the new explanation was “ governance . ” &amp; # 160 ; But this , too , made little sense , given that the Scandinavian countries – which have the most transparent governance in the world – had suffered a crisis a few years earlier .
There is , interestingly , a common thread running through all of these cases , as well as the 2008 crisis : financial sectors behaved badly and failed to assess creditworthiness and manage risk as they were supposed to do .
These problems will occur with or without the euro .
But the euro has made it more difficult for governments to respond .
And the problem is not just that the euro took away two key tools for adjustment – &amp; # 160 ; the interest rate and the exchange rate – and put nothing in their place , or that the European Central Bank ’ s mandate is to focus on inflation , whereas today ’ s challenges are unemployment , growth , and financial stability .
Without a common fiscal authority , the single market opened the way to tax competition – a race to the bottom to attract investment and boost output that could be freely sold throughout the EU .
Moreover , free labor mobility means that individuals can choose whether to pay their parents ’ debts : young Irish can simply escape repaying the foolish bank ##AT##-##AT## bailout obligations assumed by their government by leaving the country .
Of course , migration is supposed to be good , as it reallocates labor to where its return is highest .
But this kind of migration actually undermines productivity .
Migration is , of course , part of the adjustment mechanism that makes America work as a single market with a single currency .
Even more important is the federal government ’ s role in helping states that face , say , high unemployment , by allocating additional tax revenue to them – the so ##AT##-##AT## called “ transfer union ” so loathed by many Germans .
But the US is also willing to accept the depopulation of entire states that cannot compete .
( Some point out that this means that America ’ s corporations can buy senators from such states at a lower price . )
But are European countries with lagging productivity willing to accept depopulation ?
Alternatively , are they willing to face the pain of “ internal ” devaluation , a process that failed under the gold standard and is failing under the euro ?
Even if those from Europe ’ s northern countries are right in claiming that the euro would work if effective discipline could be imposed on others ( I think they are wrong ) , they are deluding themselves with a morality play .
It is fine to blame their southern compatriots for fiscal profligacy , or , in the case of Spain and Ireland , for letting free markets have free reign , without seeing where that would lead .
But that doesn ’ t address today ’ s problem : huge debts , whether a result of private or public miscalculations , must be managed within the euro framework .
Public ##AT##-##AT## sector cutbacks today do not solve the problem of yesterday ’ s profligacy ; they simply push economies into deeper recessions .
Europe ’ s leaders know this .
They know that growth is needed .
But , rather than deal with today ’ s problems and find a formula for growth , they prefer to deliver homilies about what some previous government should have done.This may be satisfying for the sermonizer , but it won ’ t solve Europe ’ s problems – and it won ’ t save the euro . &amp; # 160 ;
BEIJING – With economic globalization and the advent of a multi ##AT##-##AT## polar world , China and other emerging countries are clearly set to play much more important roles not only in 2012 , but in the coming decades .
As China ’ s economic power and influence in the world economy have increased following the financial crisis of 2008 , the idea has been floated that China and the United States should co ##AT##-##AT## lead the world under some sort of “ G ##AT##-##AT## 2 ” arrangement .
But such a G ##AT##-##AT## 2 framework is not consistent with China ’ s independent foreign policy , nor with the general trend towards wider dispersion of geopolitical power within the international community .
Although China ’ s senior leadership will change this year , this position will not change .
Indeed , when China ’ s Premier Wen Jiabao visited Prague in May 2009 for the 11th China ##AT##-##AT## European Union summit , he explained that China is opposed to the G ##AT##-##AT## 2 concept .
It is China ’ s firm intention never to seek hegemony , nor to support global domination by a small minority of countries .
What China does believe in is deepening cooperation with all of the world ’ s major regions .
Consider Europe – a splendid and time ##AT##-##AT## honored civilization , and now a major player on the world stage .
The progressive deepening of EU integration has brought dynamic vigor to the European continent ; despite Europe ’ s current difficulties , it still boasts extraordinary overall strength and international influence .
China has always supported European integration , and hopes that the EU will become a pillar of international order .
In the wake of the global financial crisis and the eurozone ’ s sovereign ##AT##-##AT## debt crisis , China has bought government bonds , made direct investments , and sent business delegations to Europe .
During Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Zapatero ’ s visit to Beijing in April 2011 , Wen reaffirmed China ’ s willingness to continue purchasing Spanish government bonds as a further demonstration of our support for Europe ’ s efforts to emerge from its crisis .
Moreover , China ’ s huge market and labor pool have created important opportunities for Europe .
In this new multi ##AT##-##AT## polar era , China and Europe must work together , and they are now at a critical moment if they are to deepen their cooperation .
What we do to share opportunities , meet challenges , and pursue development will be directly relevant not only to our own peoples ’ welfare , but also to the world ’ s future .
China ##AT##-##AT## EU cooperation will be essential to maintaining global peace and stability .
We share a commitment to resolving international issues through political means , and both sides have already played a constructive role in addressing global challenges such as climate change , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
The parallel launch of China ’ s 12th Five ##AT##-##AT## Year Plan and Europe ’ s 2020 Strategy has also helped to deepen our cooperation .
China and Europe worked together after 2008 to prevent a global financial meltdown , oppose protectionism , and promote reform of the international financial system , thus facilitating worldwide economic recovery .
China also takes its relations with the US very seriously .
Indeed , our bilateral relationship is among the most important in the international community .
That relationship has gone through some rough patches since diplomatic ties were established in 1979 , but , overall , it has continued to grow and benefit both sides .
Today , China and the US share more interests than ever , and there are encouraging prospects for still broader cooperation .
When President Hu Jintao visited Washington , DC in January 2011 , he and President Barack Obama agreed to build what Hu referred to as “ a China ##AT##-##AT## US cooperative partnership based on respect and mutual benefit . ”
They reaffirmed their deference for each other ’ s sovereignty and territorial integrity , and reached agreements on major strategic issues , including efforts to strengthen cooperation in the Asia ##AT##-##AT## Pacific region and in multilateral institutions , and to respond jointly to regional and global challenges to peace and stability , for example , on the Korean Peninsula .
China is the world ’ s largest developing country ; Europe is the largest bloc of developed countries ; and the US is the largest single developed country .
Together , we account for nearly a third of humanity and two ##AT##-##AT## thirds of the world economy .
As the three major global powers , China , the EU , and the US must strengthen their cooperation , and must work with the rest of the world to face the complex international issues that challenge us all .
Together , we must shoulder the great task of upholding world peace and promoting common development .
While China is committed to its own independent foreign policy , it cannot achieve development in isolation .
Likewise , the world cannot develop without China .
Hu once said that the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century should be a century of peace , development , and cooperation .
China is willing to join with the EU , the US , and the rest of the world to realize the potential of a truly harmonious world .
The fifteenth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution on November 17 , 1989 , which brought an end to 41 years of communist dictatorship in Czechoslovakia , is an opportunity to ponder the meaning of moral behavior and free action .
Today we live in a democratic society , but many people - not only in the Czech Republic - still believe that they are not true masters of their destiny .
They have lost faith that they can really influence political developments , much less influence the direction in which our civilization is evolving .
During the communist era , most people believed that individual efforts to effect change did not make sense .
Communist leaders insisted that the system was the result of history &apos;s objective laws , which could not be challenged , and those who refused this logic were punished - just in case .
Unfortunately , the way of thinking that supported Communist dictatorships has not disappeared entirely .
Some politicians and pundits maintain that Communism merely collapsed under its own weight - again , owing to &quot; objective laws &quot; of history .
Again , individual responsibility and individual actions are belittled . Communism , we are told , was only one of the dead ends of Western rationalism ; therefore , it was sufficient to wait passively for it to fail .
The very same people often believe in other manifestations of inevitability , such as various supposed laws of the market and other &quot; invisible hands &quot; that direct our lives .
As there is not much space in such thinking for individual moral action , social critics are often ridiculed as naive moralists or elitists .
Perhaps this is one of the reasons why 15 years after the fall of Communism , we again witness political apathy .
Democracy is increasingly seen as a mere ritual .
In general , Western societies , it seems , are experiencing a certain crisis of the democratic ethos and active citizenship .
It is possible that what we are witnessing is a mere change of paradigm , caused by new technologies , and we have nothing to worry about .
But perhaps the problem is deeper : global corporations , media cartels , and powerful bureaucracies are transforming political parties into organizations whose main task is no longer public service , but the protection of specific clienteles and interests .
Politics is becoming a battleground for lobbyists ; media trivialize serious problems ; democracy often looks like a virtual game for consumers , rather than a serious business for serious citizens .
When dreaming about a democratic future , we who were dissidents certainly had some utopian illusions , as we are well aware today .
However , we were not mistaken when we argued that Communism was not a mere dead end of Western rationalism .
Bureaucratization , anonymous manipulation , and emphasis on mass conformism were brought to &quot; perfection &quot; in the Communist system ; however , some of the very same threats are with us today .
We were already certain then that if democracy is emptied of values and reduced to a competition of political parties that have &quot; guaranteed &quot; solutions to everything , it can be quite undemocratic .
This is why we put so much emphasis on the moral dimension of politics and a vibrant civil society as counterweights to political parties and state institutions .
We also dreamed about a more just international order .
The end of the bipolar world represented a great opportunity to make the international order more humane .
Instead , we witness a process of economic globalization that has escaped political control and , as such , is causing economic havoc as well as ecological devastation in many parts of the world .
The fall of Communism was an opportunity to create more effective global political institutions based on democratic principles - institutions that could stop what appears to be , in its current form , the self ##AT##-##AT## destructive tendency of our industrial world .
If we do not want to be overrun by anonymous forces , the principles of freedom , equality and solidarity - the foundation of stability and prosperity in Western democracies - must start working globally .
But , above all , it is necessary - just as it was during the Communist era - that we not lose faith in the meaning of alternative centers of thought and civic action .
Let &apos;s not allow ourselves to be manipulated into believing that attempts to change the &quot; established &quot; order and &quot; objective &quot; laws do not make sense .
Let &apos;s try to build a global civil society , and let &apos;s insist that politics is not just a technology of power , but needs to have a moral dimension .
At the same time , politicians in democratic countries need to think seriously about reforms of international institutions , because we desperately need institutions capable of real global governance .
We could start , for example , with the United Nations , which , in its current form , is a relic of the situation shortly after the end of World War II .
It does not reflect the influence of some new regional powers , while immorally equating countries whose representatives are democratically elected and those whose representatives speak only for themselves or their juntas , at best .
We , the Europeans , have one specific task .
Industrial civilization , which now spans the whole world , originated in Europe .
All of its miracles , as well as its terrifying contradictions , can be explained as consequences of an ethos that is initially European .
Therefore , unifying Europe should set an example for the rest of the world regarding how to face the various dangers and horrors that are engulfing us today .
Indeed , such a task - which is closely tied to the success of European integration - would be an authentic fulfillment of the European sense of global responsibility . And it would be a much better strategy than cheaply blaming America for the contemporary world &apos;s various problems .
The European Commission is considering a common model of corporate taxation for the European Union that cannot possibly work .
Instead , it should consider a simpler , and more viable , alternative that already exists .
Corporate income in the EU is currently taxed under widely divergent national rules , based on separate accounting ( SA ) of income earned in each country .
Cross ##AT##-##AT## border intra ##AT##-##AT## company transactions are accounted for according to market prices for similar transactions – the so ##AT##-##AT## called “ arm ’ s ##AT##-##AT## length principle ” ( ALP ) .
The system is complex , expensive to administer , and can result in double taxation because members usually do not allow full write ##AT##-##AT## offs for losses and tax liabilities incurred abroad .
It is also prone to tax evasion , owing to different definitions of corporate income in the member states and the vast opportunities for cheating offered by ALP ( since reference market prices often do not exist ) , not to mention profit ##AT##-##AT## shifting to low ##AT##-##AT## tax jurisdictions .
The Commission is now proposing that EU companies operating in more than one member state be taxed on a common definition of earned income – the Common Consolidated Base Taxation ( CCBT ) .
Earned income would be calculated on a consolidated basis for the group and then “ apportioned ” among the member states according to a formula reflecting each business unit ’ s contribution to overall group income .
The formula could include such factors as sales , payroll , and tangible assets , as in Canada and the United States , or value ##AT##-##AT## added , adjusted to exclude imports in order to measure the value ##AT##-##AT## added “ produced ” in each country .
Each member state would remain free to decide the tax rate applicable to its portion of group income .
Under this approach , taxable income would be determined from the consolidated accounts based on international accounting standards ( IAS ) , which since 2005 have become legally binding for EU ##AT##-##AT## listed companies ’ financial reports .
This offers full tax write ##AT##-##AT## offs for losses within company groups , and transfer prices would no longer matter .
Even so , the Commission ’ s proposal has fatal shortcomings .
For one thing , the factors included in the apportionment formula would in practice be taxed at the national rates , creating fresh incentives for factor- and profit ##AT##-##AT## shifting .
But it is two other obstacles that render CCBT hopeless .
First , the IAS responds to the information needs of financial investors , but it does not provide a reliable definition of income for tax purposes .
The accrual principle typical of financial accounting is incompatible with tax systems ’ realization principle .
Moreover , the IAS leaves the allocation of profit and losses to different fiscal years largely undetermined , with each member state choosing different solutions .
Second , common legal rules on group consolidation do not exist ; indeed , many EU countries ’ commercial law contains no legal definition of a group .
The attribution of companies to a common group would need to be based on legal control , that is , ownership of some defined threshold of equity – 51 % or higher .
But a much lower share of equity often is sufficient to secure de facto control , thus encouraging groups to adapt their capital structure – moving firms in and out of the group ’ s boundaries – to minimize tax liabilities .
Clearly , CCBT is a non ##AT##-##AT## starter .
But this doesn ’ t mean that EU companies are condemned to live with 25 different national tax systems .
The idea of a common tax base must be preserved in order to simplify the system and narrow the scope for profit ##AT##-##AT## shifting .
However , a radical change in approach is required : the notion of income as a basis for corporate taxation should be scrapped altogether .
Referring to corporate income made sense when company taxation was seen as a “ back stop ” within a system of progressive taxation of personal incomes .
But most countries have now adopted “ dual ” income taxation that treat the fruits of capital more leniently than other personal income .
More importantly , the notion of corporate income is inherently arbitrary , for it is based on correct measurement of capital consumption in each tax period , which has become less and less reliable owing to the increased importance of intangibles in the value of companies .
Moreover , any tax whose proceeds increase in line with company returns is bound to discourage investment .
This disincentive disappears if the corporate tax base is decoupled from current profits and linked to some broad measure of activity .
Indeed , this would create an incentive for each company to outperform the average , since above ##AT##-##AT## average profits would go untaxed .
Another reason to scrap income and move to presumptive taxation of corporate activities stems from the EU ’ s decentralized nature .
While taxing the return on capital at the national level could discourage investment , taxing companies in exchange for location advantages might not .
Countries that offer world ##AT##-##AT## class infrastructure , high ##AT##-##AT## skill staff , and simple business rules may be well entitled to ask companies to pay a commensurate tax in return .
In sum , the EU “ federal ” corporate tax should be thought of as a benefit tax , based on a broad measure of activity , applied at a moderate rate , and unrelated to current returns ; nor should it be deductible from other taxes .
Among the various options under consideration , the value ##AT##-##AT## added tax base – perhaps averaged over a number of years – looks best , since the accounting and tax ##AT##-##AT## assessment infrastructures already exist .
Of course , value ##AT##-##AT## added includes profits , and to this extent the incentive for companies to manipulate transfer prices may reappear .
But the incentive would be much weakened , because gross returns typically represent a fairly small share of total value ##AT##-##AT## added .
This model leaves the assessment and administration of corporate taxes entirely in the hands of member states , and would not require harmonization of legal and accounting rules .
It would be transparent , simple , and easy to administer .
The gigantic apparatus for managing transfer prices and tax credit claims with foreign tax authorities could be dismantled .
Indeed , the only losers would be Europe ’ s outsized army of tax lawyers and accountants .
CAIRO – “ Whatever the majority in the People ’ s Assembly , they are very welcome , because they won ’ t have the ability to impose anything that the people don ’ t want . ”
Thus declared General Mukhtar al ##AT##-##AT## Mulla , a member of Egypt ’ s ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ( SCAF ) .
Al ##AT##-##AT## Mulla ’ s message was that the Islamists ’ victory in Egypt ’ s recent election gives them neither executive power nor control of the framing of a new constitution .
But General Sami Anan , Chief of Staff and the SCAF ’ s deputy head , quickly countered that al ##AT##-##AT## Mulla ’ s statement does not necessarily represent the official views of the Council .
So , one year after the revolution that overthrew Hosni Mubarak , who , exactly , will set Egypt ’ s political direction ?
The electoral victory of the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s political wing and the Salafi parties , which together won more than 70 % of the parliamentary seats , will give them strong influence over the transitional period and in drafting the constitution .
But they are not alone .
Aside from the Islamists , two other powerful actors will have their say : the “ Tahrirists ” and the generals .
Tahrir Square ##AT##-##AT## based activism has not only brought about social and political change , but also has served as the ultimate tool of pro ##AT##-##AT## democracy pressure on Egypt ’ s military rulers .
Indeed , while the army , the most powerful of the three actors , still officially controls the country , there is little confidence in the generals ’ commitment to democracy .
“ The SCAF are either anti ##AT##-##AT## democratic … .or some of their advisers told them that democracy is not in their best interest , ” says Hazem Abd al ##AT##-##AT## Azim , a nominee in the first post ##AT##-##AT## Mubarak government .
If the generals do not want democracy , nor do they want direct military rule à la Augusto Pinochet .
So , what do they want ?
Ideally , they would like to combine the Algerian army ’ s current power and the Turkish army ’ s legitimacy .
This implies a parliament with limited powers , a weak presidency subordinate to the army , and constitutional prerogatives that legitimate the army ’ s intervention in politics .
The minimum that they insist on is reflected in statements by Generals al ##AT##-##AT## Mulla , Mamdouh Shahim , Ismail Etman , and others .
That would mean a veto in high politics , independence for the army ’ s budget and vast economic empire , legal immunity from prosecution on charges stemming from corruption or repression , and constitutional prerogatives to guarantee these arrangements .
The new parliament and constitutional assembly will have to lead the negotiations with the SCAF .
But , given that any successful democratic transition must include meaningful civilian control over the armed forces and the security apparatus , the SCAF ’ s minimum demands could render the process meaningless .
The veto in high politics would include any issues that touch on national security or sensitive foreign policy , most importantly the relationship with Israel .
With an Islamist majority in the parliament promising to “ revise ” the peace agreement with Israel , tensions over foreign policy are likely to rise .
The independent military ##AT##-##AT## commercial empire , which benefits from preferential customs and exchange rates , no taxation , land ##AT##-##AT## confiscation rights , and an army of almost ##AT##-##AT## free laborers ( conscripted soldiers ) , is another thorny issue .
With the Egyptian economy suffering , elected politicians might seek to improve conditions by moving against the military ’ s civilian assets – namely , by revising the preferential rates and imposing a form of taxation .
Immunity from prosecution is no less salient .
“ The Field ##AT##-##AT## Marshal should be in jail now , ” screamed the elected leftist MP , Abu Ezz al ##AT##-##AT## Hariri , on the second day of the new parliamentary session .
When Mahmoud Ghozlan , the Muslim Brotherhood spokesperson , proposed immunity ( known in Egypt as the “ safe ##AT##-##AT## exit ” option ) , he faced a wave of harsh criticism .
Pressure from the United States has also influenced the SCAF ’ s decision ##AT##-##AT## making .
“ The military establishment receives $ 1.3 billion from the US … .They are very sensitive to US requests , ” according to Saad Eddin Ibrahim , who lobbied the Obama administration to support the revolution in January 2011 .
But most of the SCAF ’ s pro ##AT##-##AT## democracy decisions have come as a result of massive pressure from Tahrir Square .
This includes the removal of Mubarak , his trial ( and that of other regime figures ) , and bringing forward the presidential election from 2013 to June 2012 .
Two other factors are equally , if not more , influential : the status quo inherited from the Mubarak era and the army ’ s internal cohesion .
With few exceptions , the SCAF ’ s members benefited significantly from Mubarak ’ s regime .
They will attempt to preserve as much of it as possible .
“ The sight of officers in uniform protesting in Tahrir Square and speaking on Al Jazeera really worries the Field Marshal , ” a former officer told me .
And one way to maintain internal cohesion is to create “ demons ” – a lesson learned from the “ dirty wars ” in Algeria in the 1990 ’ s and Argentina in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s .
In particular , Coptic protesters are an easy target against which to rally soldiers and officers .
Last October , amid an unnecessary escalation of sectarian violence , state ##AT##-##AT## owned television featured a hospitalized Egyptian soldier screaming , “ The Copts killed my colleague ! ”
The systematic demonization of the Tahririst groups , and the violent escalation that followed in November and December , served the same purpose .
Despite everything , democratic Egypt is not a romantic fantasy .
A year ago , Saad al ##AT##-##AT## Ketatni , the Muslim Brotherhood leader , would never have dreamed of being Speaker of Parliament .
The same applies to the leftists and liberals who now hold around 20 % of the parliament ’ s seats .
If 2011 witnessed the miracle of Mubarak ’ s removal , a brave parliament ’ s institutional assertiveness , coupled with non ##AT##-##AT## institutional Tahririst pressure , could force the generals to accept a transfer of power to civilian rule ( with some reserved domains for the army establishment ) in 2012 .
What is certain is that this year will not witness a return to the conditions of 2010 .
Egypt may become stuck in democratization ’ s slow lane , but there will be no U ##AT##-##AT## turn .
The hundreds of thousands who marched to Tahrir Square on the revolution ’ s anniversary will guarantee that .
NEW YORK – When caricature takes the place of dialogue , everyone suffers – especially when it comes to understanding issues affecting women , who struggle worldwide against being silenced .
Some right ##AT##-##AT## wing American bloggers recently twisted an article that I wrote in a way that did just that .
I wrote that many women activists in Muslim countries tend to emphasize issues such as honor killings , legal inequality , and lack of access to education , and that they express frustration that the obsession among Westerners with Muslim women ’ s clothing can come at the expense of these concerns .
I also pointed out that many Muslim feminists defend their dress in terms of nationalism , anti ##AT##-##AT## imperialism , or as a matter of faith .
This provoked a small firestorm of distortion in the West : “ Wolf Wants to Institutionalize the Burka , ” etc . It was depressing to see a simple appeal for Westerners to listen to Muslim women deliberately distorted into a representation of all Muslim women as meek , will ##AT##-##AT## less beings in need of rescue .
The women leaders I met in Amman were not saying , “ Please tell the West to save us . ” They were too busy making egalitarian , modernist new worlds of their own , with an Arab , and often Islamic , imprimatur .
Princess Rym Ali , sister ##AT##-##AT## in ##AT##-##AT## law of Queen Rania – the Chanel ##AT##-##AT## wearing media star who is rebranding a more contemporary Jordan – is one vivid example ; Princess Rym is making immense progress in a more behind ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## scenes way .
She met me in a leafy Amman suburb , in the palace that she shares with Prince Ali and their small children .
A former CNN journalist , her quiet bearing and diplomatic manner belie her courage : she captured her husband ’ s heart as she was reporting from Baghdad on the eve of “ shock and awe , ” standing firm before the cameras even as the bombs were falling .
Princess Rym and Prince Ali have supported a new film institute , the Red Sea Institute of Cinematic Arts , a joint production with the University of Southern California that is bringing together bright young people from all over the Middle East to learn contemporary filmmaking , apprentice with international film productions , and get the region ’ s stories out .
Though she can no longer practice journalism directly , Princess Rym is also co ##AT##-##AT## founding new Jordanian journalism school .
Her aim is to replace journalists ’ acceptance of the “ party line ” – even if the party is her own extended family – with a more critical perspective .
She directed my attention to Jordanian ##AT##-##AT## made films about the subordination of women inside the home , and to Rana Husseini ’ s powerful book on honor killings , Murder in the Name of Honor .
But her implicit message was that these critical examinations of women ’ s inequality in the Arab world are most enlightening when they are created by women ’ s advocates from within that culture , rather than sensationalized or superficial versions of the problem created in the West .
Mary Nazzal , owner , with her family , of a chic and bustling boutique hotel , is another dynamo who looks as if she stepped out of a fashion shoot .
But it would be a mistake to underestimate her seriousness .
I call her “ Martha Stewart meets Che Guevara , ” because , when not renovating the elegant public spaces of her hotel , she is suing Israeli generals for war crimes that she claims were committed against civilians in Gaza .
Nazzal was trained as a British barrister , and chairs the board of the Human Rights Legal Aid Fund .
Her organization is intent on using international law to hold accountable members of the Israeli military who put civilians in harm ’ s way during the invasion of Gaza – events that the recent Goldstone Report confirms .
She is passionate about the Palestinian cause , mixing her cutting ##AT##-##AT## edge legal advocacy with a willingness to listen to decent people from all sides of the conflict , and a fierce attachment to peace in the region based on due process and justice .
Finally there is Rana Husseini herself – a role model for investigative reporters everywhere who began documenting and investigating honor killings in her newspaper , The Jordan Times .
Honor killings claim an estimated 5,000 women every year , and are increasingly common in immigrant communities abroad .
According to her account , a woman can be killed for “ laughing at a joke in the street , wearing makeup or a short skirt … or being raped by a brother . ”
After she began her series of reports , Husseini received death threats at her office almost daily – as well as hundreds of letters of support from readers .
As a result of her brave investigations , which included interviews in prisons , many Muslim countries are revising their criminal codes , and the issue has taken center stage internationally .
These women are exactly the kind of leaders that everyone should be cultivating and supporting , rather than overlooking because of a belief that they cannot exist in the Middle East .
We would do better to find out more about them than to waste our time on superficial debates about how they – and many others who are just as accomplished – should dress .
When the leaders of the world &apos;s richest nations gather in Evian , France , one unasked question will dominate : what does America want in the world ?
So it may be helpful to outline the principles and ideas that guide US foreign policy .
First , inconsistency is no vice .
Indeed , in foreign policymaking , inconsistency is often a virtue .
I speak not of principles , but of policy .
The US does not have a &quot; one size fits all &quot; approach to the world .
What happened in Iraq should not be over ‑ interpreted as a rigid template for US policy toward countries that pursue weapons of mass destruction , support terrorism , or deny people liberty .
In Iraq , the US used force as a last resort , against a country with a clear record of aggression , and after a large degree of international consensus had developed about what Iraq needed to do .
Different policies ##AT##-##AT## tailored for local , regional , and international realities ##AT##-##AT## will be needed to meet the challenges posed by North Korea , Iran , Syria , or elsewhere .
America &apos;s armed forces are an essential background to much of what the US accomplishes internationally .
But defense policy is only one component of foreign policy .
Not every threat to America &apos;s national interests can be addressed with military power .
If all you have to work with is a hammer , as the saying goes , every problem looks like a nail .
Success in foreign policy , as in carpentry , requires the right tools for the job .
Partnership is essential here .
For all of America &apos;s power , there is little that the US can do in the world that it can &apos;t do better with the active participation of others , be they governments , international organizations , or non ##AT##-##AT## governmental organizations .
Partnership facilitates solutions to problems that defy purely national responses and means that burdens are shared .
America relies on partnerships in the global war on terrorism : foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement cooperation ; trading partners ensure the security of shipping containers ; private financial institutions help track the transfers of funds that sustain terror networks .
Beyond partnerships , international institutions add value ##AT##-##AT## provided they are effectively organized , have realistic mandates , and contain members that are committed to common norms and aims .
Such institutions can and often do advance US national interests .
Indeed , it would be difficult to carry out critical dimensions of US foreign policy ##AT##-##AT## from trade to non ‑ proliferation to environmental policy ##AT##-##AT## without them .
The World Trade Organization is a case in point .
It provides a forum in which to negotiate new trade liberalization agreements , seek remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies , and resolve disputes with trading partners .
But the US must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities .
NATO , for example , is evolving from a Cold War alliance focused solely on Europe to one suited to meeting today &apos;s security challenges wherever they may arise , such as in Afghanistan and possibly Iraq .
Multilateralism is most successful when built on a real convergence of interests and values .
The UN and other global frameworks may sometimes be best placed to address US foreign policy goals .
When the UN or other bodies are unwilling or unable to move against dire threats , America reserves the right to act in less encompassing alliances or flexible , ad hoc coalitions of the willing .
Not even the UN has a monopoly on legitimacy , which depends most on an action &apos;s rationale and the manner in which it is undertaken .
This flexibility is needed because of the nature of the challenges that loom on the horizon .
We ignore failing states at our peril , because anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can offer a haven for terrorists , criminals , and drug traffickers .
One of our most pressing tasks today is to prevent the implosion of weak states .
Another is to assist countries that have collapsed into violence to begin the slow process of recovery .
One impulse behind America &apos;s international engagement , and one of the great sources of its global power , has been its enduring impulse to make the world a better place .
Any US foreign policy must combine interests and values , because the American public always insists that US national objectives be linked to national ideals .
The appeal of US leadership abroad rests in part on the attractiveness of America &apos;s political institutions , society , and culture , and its willingness to champion human rights and democracy .
At the same time , our efforts to promote democracy worldwide serve US interests , owing to the hardheaded realization that democracies settle their differences peaceably .
Today &apos;s world lacks irreconcilable conflict among the main concentrations of world power : Europe , Russia , China , Japan , and the US .
This congruence of interest and agreement on the rules of international order offers a promising foundation for managing the common challenges that confront us all .
Our over ‑ riding goal should be to create a world in which governments , organizations , and peoples embrace arrangements that allow them to realize their shared interests and that reflect fundamental universal values .
Everyone has an interest in a world in which force is used only as a last resort , terrorism is regarded as beyond the pale , weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used , free trade becomes the norm , citizens enjoy basic liberties , democratic values triumph , and the rule of law replaces the way of the gun .
Bringing such an integrated world may be optimistic , even idealistic , but it is hardly naive .
OSAKA – Three months after the Democratic Party of Japan ’ s landslide general ##AT##-##AT## election victory , the new administration ’ s foreign and security policy appears to be increasingly at odds with that of the United States .
Indeed , there is growing concern on both sides of the Pacific that Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama intends to turn away from the declining US hegemon and reach out to a rising China .
Indeed , Hatoyama has announced his rudimentary vision of building an East Asian community that excludes the US .
Hatoyama has hastily attempted to fulfill the DPJ ’ s party manifesto and his own public pledges .
This includes terminating replenishment support for the US ##AT##-##AT## led interdiction operation in the Indian Ocean , reducing host ##AT##-##AT## nation support to US forces based in Japan , and revising the bilateral status ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## force agreement .
Moreover , Hatoyama is set to expose a secret Cold War nuclear agreement that opened Japanese ports to US naval vessels carrying nuclear weapons , in contravention of Japan ’ s Three Non ##AT##-##AT## Nuclear Principles , which have guided official policy since the late 1960 ’ s .
Last but not least , Hatoyama is postponing implementation of a bilateral agreement with the US to relocate a Marine Corps base on the island of Okinawa , from Futenma to Henoko , thereby causing confusion for America ’ s plan to relocate part of its forces on Okinawa to Guam .
The significance of these moves has , however , been poorly understood .
Hatoyama ’ s assertiveness vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis the US is in accord with Japan ’ s position as the world ’ s largest creditor with the least damaged banking sector .
But a decisive foreign ##AT##-##AT## policy shift has not occurred – nor will one occur in the near future .
Instead , Hatoyama has simply stressed Japan ’ s need to be on an equal footing in alliance management with the US .
Likewise , his proposed regional community would be open in nature , and would welcome strong US involvement , although without formal US membership , on geographic grounds .
Thus , the current US ##AT##-##AT## Japanese estrangement is being driven by a spiral of mistrust that does not stem from geo ##AT##-##AT## strategic concerns .
Rather , Japan has initiated a series of abrupt policy changes , while the US , only dimly aware of the significance of its relative decline , assumes that Japan ’ s decades ##AT##-##AT## long docility will continue .
Flaws in the transition between Japanese governments are also to blame .
Hatoyama ’ s ministers did not ask their counterparts in the departing administration of former Prime Minister Taro Aso to inform them fully about existing and potential foreign ##AT##-##AT## policy problems . Nor did the Aso government ’ s members , stupefied by their crushing electoral defeat , offer to do so .
The relocation of the Marine Corps base – an issue burdened by the competing imperatives of Hatoyama ’ s coalition government , American military strategy , and local anti ##AT##-##AT## base politics on the island of Okinawa – is now a focal point of tensions with the US .
The base agreement – reached after ten years of bilateral negotiations – is the most practical option for avoiding potentially disastrous aerial accidents in a heavily populated area , and for reducing crimes committed by US soldiers against local Japanese , including , most notoriously , several rapes .
The base agreement is essential for maintaining the political and strategic viability of the bilateral alliance .
Yet , during the DPJ ’ s election campaign , Hatoyama vowed to eliminate the Marines ’ presence on Okinawa .
To make matters worse , the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) has threatened to leave the government coalition if Hatoyama breaks his promise – a move that would deny the DPJ a simple majority in the Diet ’ s upper house .
Nor does it hold the two ##AT##-##AT## thirds majority in the lower house needed to override upper ##AT##-##AT## house resolutions .
Thus , Hatoyama is forced to subordinate Japan ’ s alliance with the US to his government ’ s survival , at least until next summer ’ s upper ##AT##-##AT## house elections .
By then , the government will have enacted more of its legislative program , potentially enabling the DPJ to gain seats .
Hatoyama cannot please everyone all the time , least of all the US .
While he has repeatedly emphasized Japan ’ s equal footing with the US in alliance management , this does not extend to Japan ’ s military capability and defense burden .
Obviously , he intends to keep asymmetrical reciprocity embedded in the bilateral mutual security treaty : the US defends Japan , and Japan leases to the US many large bases that are essential to its global military posture .
Moreover , he evidently believes that the geo ##AT##-##AT## strategic value of the bases enable him to bargain for a major US compromise .
If this approach does not work , and if the existing Marine base on Okinawa remains , Hatoyama can pass the buck to the US , thereby deflecting anti ##AT##-##AT## base pressure from local residents .
He would also retain the current Marine Corps presence as a tripwire for US military intervention in the case of a flare ##AT##-##AT## up across the Taiwan Strait , whereas Guam is beyond the effective range of Chinese ballistic missiles .
Hatoyama is certainly a clever political tactician , but that is not sufficient to make him a wise leader .
Above all , he must not play with fire : the US ##AT##-##AT## Japan alliance is a public good that is indispensable for the peace and security of the Asia ##AT##-##AT## Pacific region .
FRANKFURT – What constitutes a crisis ?
Is it sustained economic decline , high and long ##AT##-##AT## term unemployment , poverty , rampant inflation , a precipitous fall in the exchange rate , fiscal deficits , high borrowing costs , and political dysfunction ?
Most would agree that a crisis exists if just some of these “ misery indices ” are present .
But , while Europe is widely perceived to be in the grip of crisis , only a handful of them are present , and in only a few eurozone countries .
So , why is there a eurozone crisis , and what defines it ?
Time and again , it is argued that the single currency does not fit the different needs of its member countries , and that unsustainable economic divergence will ultimately require that the euro be abandoned .
The fatal divergences that are most frequently cited include differences in growth rates , job ##AT##-##AT## creation , and unemployment rates , as well as dramatic disparities in current ##AT##-##AT## account balances , all of which may be traceable to wide deviations in unit labor costs .
Perceptions of such divergences force considerable risk premiums on problem countries , inevitably resulting in accelerating capital flight to safe havens .
All of these developments are now visible in the eurozone , particularly in its peripheral countries .
Risk premiums started rising above benign levels in 2009 , and then more strongly in 2011 ##AT##-##AT## 2012 , while capital flight became rampant in 2011 .
But , if one considers what might underlie capital movements of this sort , suspicion must also fall on unsustainable policies that extend to countries well outside the eurozone .
In the wider European Union , countries like the United Kingdom or Hungary are as much afflicted by structural deficiencies as some peripheral eurozone countries are .
Exchange ##AT##-##AT## rate flexibility has not helped them much , or at least they have chosen not to exploit it .
Moreover , there are countries with government ##AT##-##AT## debt burdens that are as large , if not larger , than those on Europe ’ s periphery – the United States and Japan being prime examples .
Other countries , like Norway and Switzerland , are running current ##AT##-##AT## account surpluses that exceed 10 % of their GDP , but are resisting currency revaluation .
It is worth remembering that , for the decade until 2005 , Germany was labeled the “ sick man of Europe . ”
Germany was uncompetitive when it entered the eurozone , owing to excessive wage and price increases following the country ’ s reunification – a problem that has since been overcome by structural reforms that the country undertook within the single currency .
The same is true for the most recent eurozone member , Estonia , whose rigorous wage restraint ensured competitiveness in the single market in a short period of time .
Why , then , is there such strong doubt that the euro can survive ?
Some say that the current efforts to enforce sound policies in the peripheral countries are bound to fail , and that sacrificing democracy in these countries to keep the monetary union intact is too high a price to pay .
In fact , the efforts of governments and international institutions point the way toward more sustainable solutions .
Who would have believed at this time last year that the fiscal pact adopted in March would have been possible ?
And , despite fluctuations , has there not been a considerable reduction in risk premiums for problem countries , without adding to the financing costs of donor countries ?
Much remains unknown .
Are we seeing tentative signs of escape from the eurozone ’ s malaise ?
Will debtor countries be able to stick to tough reform programs , or will their citizens reject austerity ?
And will donor countries avoid the sort of populist backlash at home that might push them in a protectionist direction ?
Intelligent cooperation that avoids moral hazard should be able to prevent panic , reduce risk premiums , and permit fuller use of resources .
For example , transnational migration flows should certainly be made easier and more attractive .
High levels of unemployment , particularly among young skilled workers , could be avoided if donor countries that need migrants to invigorate their own workforces were able to attract them .
More immigration would strengthen skills and raise income levels , while reducing distressed countries ’ expenditure on unemployment benefits .
Greater labor mobility within the EU would also help to create a more open European mindset , and thus weaken old nationalist prejudices .
So , will Europe commit to moving toward political union , and thereby address what has remained missing , despite the single market , the euro , and the Schengen Agreement ’ s elimination of internal borders ?
The model for a future United States of Europe is Switzerland , a country with four languages and ethnicities , fiscally strong sub ##AT##-##AT## national units ( cantons ) , a single first ##AT##-##AT## rate currency , and a federal government and a parliament that exercises genuine , if limited , fiscal authority .
If the EU made the most of the competencies that it already has , and governed more effectively , the Union as a whole could achieve faster economic growth for at least the next decade , with a 2.5 % annual rate not out of reach .
More generous support for countries in trouble is essential , because the euro must be preserved ( albeit not necessarily on the base of a larger eurozone ) .
Financial markets would be more easily convinced if such support were complemented by the recipient countries ’ acceptance of the fiscal pact , together with technical help to strengthen their governance .
In Greece , anti ##AT##-##AT## corruption officers from the US , Italian tax ##AT##-##AT## efficiency specialists , German privatization experts , and Spanish tourism professionals should be made available to accelerate the pace of modernization .
All of this amounts to a much ##AT##-##AT## needed and often ##AT##-##AT## advocated Marshall Plan for the periphery .
But it recognizes that what Europe ’ s troubled countries need most is not money , but the planning and administrative capacity to spend it effectively .
Over the last decade , Greece could absorb only a fifth of the EU modernization funds available to it .
It didn ’ t have to be that way then , and Europe cannot afford to let it remain that way now .
Hamas understands the political obligations that it must meet in order to be fully accepted in the world community , but its leaders prefer to wait until they are fully empowered before exploring these issues .
Moreover , Hamas , like most Palestinians , is trying to evaluate the best way forward in the peace process .
In their eyes , the current process produced years of inaction in negotiations , allowing for continued occupation and theft of Palestinian lands .
As an example , Hamas leaders point out that in the past year , with the moderate Mahmoud Abbas in power , the Israelis have not even negotiated with him .
So , from their point of view , Israel is not going to rush to negotiate with any Palestinian authority , whether it recognizes Israel ’ s right to exist or not .
Instead , the newly elected Hamas leaders are preoccupied with basic issues like preserving internal unity among Palestinians , ending lawlessness , ensuring greater respect for the rule of law , fighting corruption , and reforming Palestinian governance .
Most Palestinians are in complete agreement with these priorities .
Indeed , the latest public opinion poll among Palestinians shows that 73 % feel as secure as or even more secure than they did before the election .
Of the 709 randomly selected Palestinians who were surveyed , 30 % said that they hope the new Hamas government tackles corruption .
Twenty ##AT##-##AT## two percent said that they hope Ismael Haniyeh , Hamas ’ s designated prime minister , will end the chaos in Palestinian towns and provide internal security and the rule of law .
Almost one in five hoped that unemployment would be addressed .
Ironically , while the majority of Palestinians voted a religious movement into power , only 1 % of those polled said that Hamas ’ s priority should be to implement Islamic law in Palestine .
While the poll showed that an overwhelming 73 % of Palestinians still support a peace deal with Israel , they are not confident that any deal is around the corner .
Eleven percent of the respondents said that the prisoner issue should be the most important priority for the new government – nearly twice the number who said that a peace settlement with Israel should be the top priority .
More than 8,000 Palestinians are held in Israeli prisons , many without charge or trial .
Nevertheless , 62 % of Palestinians said that they believe Hamas should change its position regarding recognition of Israel .
It is difficult for an international superpower like the US or a regional one like Israel to realize that a group or a people dare to have priorities different from theirs .
But Palestinians have shown over the years that they are a proud people who will not cave in just because the other side is militarily or politically more powerful .
In any case , Hamas cannot be blamed for using America ’ s push for democracy to attain popular goals .
After all , anyone who wants to be re ##AT##-##AT## elected must give priority to the needs of their own people and not necessarily to the demands of the international community .
Only when elected representatives deal with the day ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## day issues that face their people can they begin to tackle external negotiations .
What is clear is that Hamas and the Palestinians want an end to the 38 ##AT##-##AT## year Israeli occupation , and that selling Palestinians the same plans that were sold to the PLO will not work .
If Israel and the international community are genuinely serious about ending the occupation , Hamas will cooperate .
While Hamas must be flexible in dealing with legitimate requests by the international community , the international community is obliged to provide an effective road map to peace .
Once Palestinians are convinced that there is an opportunity for genuine peace and independence , they will press Hamas to act on it – or elect a party that will .
Clearly , the international community has lacked the political will to press Israel to change .
For the time being , and until this will is found , the world should give Hamas time to deal with the daily needs of Palestinians .
Once the possibility of serious negotiations appears , a Hamas that has improved the lives of ordinary Palestinians will be in a position to carry out the negotiations that will be needed for a historic compromise .
CHICAGO – Emerging markets around the world – Brazil , China , India , and Russia , to name the largest – are slowing .
One reason is that they continue to be dependent , directly or indirectly , on exports to advanced industrial countries .
Slow growth there , especially in Europe , is economically depressing .
But a second reason is that they each have important weaknesses , which they have not overcome in good times .
For China , it is excessive reliance on fixed ##AT##-##AT## asset investment for growth .
In Brazil , low savings and various institutional impediments keep interest rates high and investment low , while the educational system does not serve significant parts of the population well .
And Russia , despite a very well educated population , continues to be reliant on commodity industries for economic growth .
Hardest to understand , though , is why India is underperforming so much relative to its potential .
Indeed , annual GDP growth has fallen by five percentage points since 2010 .
For a country as poor as India , growth should be what Americans call a “ no ##AT##-##AT## brainer . ”
It is largely a matter of providing public goods : basic infrastructure like roads , bridges , ports , and power , as well as access to education and basic health care .
And , unlike many equally poor countries , India already has a very strong entrepreneurial class , a reasonably large and well ##AT##-##AT## educated middle class , and a number of world ##AT##-##AT## class corporations that can be enlisted in the effort to provide these public goods .
Satisfying the demand for such goods is itself a source of growth .
But , also , a reliable road creates tremendous additional activity , as trade increases between connected areas , and myriad businesses , restaurants , and hotels spring up along the way .
As India did away with the stultifying License Raj in the 1990 ’ s , successive governments understood the imperative of economic growth , so much so that the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) contested the 2004 election on a pro ##AT##-##AT## development platform , encapsulated in the slogan , “ India Shining . ”
But the BJP ##AT##-##AT## led coalition lost that election .
Whether the debacle reflected the BJP ’ s unfortunate choice of coalition partners or its emphasis on growth when too many Indians had not benefited from it , the lesson for politicians was that growth did not provide electoral rewards .
In any event , that election suggested a need to spread the benefits of growth to rural areas and the poor .
There are two ways of going about that .
The first , which is harder and takes time , is to increase income ##AT##-##AT## generating capabilities in rural areas , and among the poor , by improving access to education , health care , finance , water , and power .
The second is to increase voters ’ spending power through populist subsidies and transfers , which typically tend to be directed toward the politically influential rather than the truly needy .
In the years after the BJP ’ s loss , with a few notable exceptions , India ’ s political class decided that traditional populism was a surer route to re ##AT##-##AT## election .
This perception also accorded well with the median ( typically poor ) voter ’ s low expectation of government in India – seeing it as a source of sporadic handouts rather than of reliable public services .
For a few years , the momentum created by previous reforms , together with strong global growth , carried India forward .
Politicians saw little need to vote for further reforms , especially those that would upset powerful vested interests .
The lurch toward populism was strengthened when the Congress ##AT##-##AT## led United Progressive Alliance concluded that a rural employment ##AT##-##AT## guarantee scheme and a populist farm ##AT##-##AT## loan waiver aided its victory in the 2009 election .
But , while politicians spent the growth dividend on poorly targeted giveaways such as subsidized petrol and cooking gas , the need for further reform only increased .
For example , industrialization requires a transparent system for acquiring land from farmers and tribal people , which in turn presupposes much better land ##AT##-##AT## ownership records than India has .
As demand for land and land prices increased , corruption became rampant , with some politicians , industrialists , and bureaucrats using the lack of transparency in land ownership and zoning to misappropriate assets .
India ’ s corrupt elites had moved from controlling licenses to cornering newly valuable resources like land .
The Resource Raj rose from the ashes of the License Raj .
India ’ s citizenry eventually reacted .
An eclectic mix of idealistic and opportunistic politicians and NGOs mobilized people against land acquisitions .
With investigative journalists getting into the act , land acquisition became a political land mine .
Moreover , key institutions , such as the Comptroller and Auditor General and the judiciary , staffed by an increasingly angry middle class , also launched investigations .
As evidence emerged of widespread corruption in contracts and resource allocation , ministers , bureaucrats , and high ##AT##-##AT## level corporate officers were arrested , and some have spent long periods in jail .
The collateral effect , however , is that even honest officials are now too frightened to help corporations to navigate India ’ s maze of bureaucracy .
As a result , industrial , mining , and infrastructure projects have ground to a halt .
Populist government spending and the inability of the supply side of the economy to keep pace has , in turn , led to elevated inflation , while Indian households , worried that no asset looks safe , have taken to investing in gold .
Because India does not produce much gold itself , these purchases have contributed to an abnormally wide current ##AT##-##AT## account deficit .
Not much more was required to dampen foreign investors ’ enthusiasm for the India story , with the rupee falling significantly in recent weeks .
As with the other major emerging markets , India ’ s fate is in its own hands .
Hard times tend to concentrate minds .
If its politicians can take a few steps to show that they can overcome narrow partisan interests to establish the more transparent and efficient government that a middle ##AT##-##AT## income country needs , they could quickly re ##AT##-##AT## energize India ’ s enormous engines of potential growth .
Otherwise , India ’ s youth , their hopes and ambitions frustrated , could decide to take matters into their own hands .
NEW YORK – Mohammed al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi was a 31 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old Yemeni citizen who was held at Guantánamo Bay without charge for seven years .
On June 3 , while I was visiting Guantánamo with other journalists , the press office there issued a terse announcement that al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi had had been found dead in his cell – an “ apparent suicide . ”
Because my commercial flight was canceled , I got a ride back to the United States on a military transport .
I happened to be seated next to a military physician who had been flown in to do the autopsy on al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi .
When would there be an investigation of the death , I asked him ? “ That was the investigation , ” he replied .
The military had investigated the military .
This “ apparent suicide ” seemed immediately suspicious to me .
I had just toured those cells : it is literally impossible to kill yourself in them .
Their interiors resemble the inside of a smooth plastic jar ; there are no hard edges ; hooks fold down ; there is no bedding that one can use to strangle oneself .
Can you bang your head against the wall until you die , theoretically , I asked the doctor ? “ They check on prisoners every three minutes , ” he said .
You ’ d have to be fast .
The story smelled even worse after a bit of digging .
Al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi , it turned out , had been elected by the detainees to serve as their representative .
( The Geneva Conventions call for this process but the US did not give it any formal recognition ) .
As their designated representative , al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi knew which prisoners had claimed to have been tortured or abused , and by whom .
On January 17 , al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi , according to his fellow prisoner Binyam Mohamed ( who has since been released ) , was summoned to a meeting with the Admiral of Guantánamo and the head of the Guard Force there .
He never returned to his cell .
He was taken to the psychiatric ward , where , according to another prisoner who had been there , he was kept until he died .
Can you kill yourself in the psych ward ?
According to Cortney Busch of Reprieve , a British organization that represents Guantánamo detainees , there is video running on prisoners in the psychiatric ward at all times , and there is a guard posted there continually , too .
The day after al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi died , the nurse and psychologist had shown a group of journalists of which I was a part an oddly defensive display of how hunger ##AT##-##AT## striking prisoners are bound in restraint chairs when being “ enterally fed ” ( that is , force ##AT##-##AT## fed ) .
Al Hanashi , the press office at Guantánamo noted , had formerly been a hunger striker .
It is worth considering how easy it would be to do away with a troublesome prisoner being force ##AT##-##AT## fed by merely adjusting the calorie level .
If it is too low , the prisoner will starve , but too high a level can also kill , since deliberate liquid overfeeding by tube , to which Guantánamo prisoners have reported being subjected , causes vomiting , diarrhea , and deadly dehydration that can stop one ’ s heart .
I have been putting questions to Lt. Commander Brook DeWalt , the head spokesman for the Guantánamo press office , about how al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi died , for eight weeks now .
According to the Yemeni embassy in Washington , al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi ’ s body was repatriated in mid ##AT##-##AT## August .
Al Jazeera has reported that the Yemeni government announced only what the US had – that al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi had died from “ asphyxiation . ”
When I noted to DeWalt that self ##AT##-##AT## strangulation was impossible , he said he would get back to me when the inquiry – now including a Naval criminal investigation – was completed .
I have yet to receive an answer .
The Yemeni government , too , notes that they have yet to receive the coroner ’ s report from the US .
An investigation by the military of the death of its own prisoners violates the Geneva Conventions , which demand that illness , transfer , and death of prisoners be registered independently with a neutral authority ( such as the ICRC ) , and that deaths be investigated independently .
If governments let no outside entity investigate the circumstances of such deaths , what will keep them from “ disappearing ” whomever they take into custody , for whatever reason ?
I sent DeWalt a copy of the relevant section of the Geneva Conventions and asked how the US military ’ s handling of al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi ’ s death conforms to it .
Actually , I sent it twice .
Again , no answer .
Was al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi suicidal ?
Binyam Mohamed told the Associated Press that al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi was a positive person ( and , one can assume , a natural leader ) who would never consider suicide .
He had been in custody for seven years without a lawyer , and killed himself just two weeks after having finally been assigned one ?
That lawyer , Elizabeth Gilson , probably knows al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi ’ s state of mind before he died , but the US government will not allow her to talk about it .
What happened to Mohamed al ##AT##-##AT## Hanashi , and why ?
The fact that no one can answer this question yet means that even in Barack Obama ’ s America , as in Stalin ’ s Russia or Ahmadinejad ’ s Iran , people can simply be disappeared without trial .
The world ’ s law ##AT##-##AT## abiding governments and ordinary citizens should call and email DeWalt , the Pentagon , and the White House press office to demand answers .
A young man with a great deal of potentially compromising information died under suspicious circumstances in US custody .
The facts concerning his case must be independently verified .

COPENHAGEN – Advocates of drastic cuts in carbon ##AT##-##AT## dioxide emissions now speak a lot less than they once did about climate change .
Climate campaigners changed their approach after the collapse of the Copenhagen climate ##AT##-##AT## change summit last December and the revelation of mistakes in the United Nations climate panel ’ s work – as well as in response to growing public skepticism and declining interest .
Although some activists still rely on scare tactics – witness the launch of an advertisement depicting the bombing of anybody who is hesitant to embrace carbon cuts – many activists now spend more time highlighting the “ benefits ” of their policy prescription .
They no longer dwell on impending climate doom , but on the economic windfall that will result from embracing the “ green ” economy .
You can find examples all over the world , but one of the best is in my home country , Denmark , where a government ##AT##-##AT## appointed committee of academics recently presented their suggestions for how the country could go it alone and become “ fossil fuel ##AT##-##AT## free ” in 40 years .
The goal is breathtaking : more than 80 % of Denmark ’ s energy supply comes from fossil fuels , which are dramatically cheaper and more reliable than any green energy source .
I attended the committee ’ s launch and was startled that the “ Climate Commission ” barely mentioned climate change .
This omission is understandable , since one country acting alone cannot do much to stop global warming .
If Denmark were indeed to become 100 % fossil ##AT##-##AT## free by 2050 , and remain so for the rest of the century , the effect , by 2100 , would be to delay the rise in average global temperature by just two weeks .
Instead of focusing on climate change , the Climate Commission hyped the benefits that Denmark would experience if it led the shift to green energy .
Unfortunately , on inspection these benefits turn out to be illusory .
Being a pioneer is hardly a guarantee of riches .
Germany led the world in putting up solar panels , funded by € 47 billion in subsidies .
The lasting legacy is a massive bill , and lots of inefficient solar technology sitting on rooftops throughout a fairly cloudy country , delivering a trivial 0.1 % of its total energy supply .
Denmark itself has also already tried being a green ##AT##-##AT## energy innovator – it led the world in embracing wind power .
The results are hardly inspiring .
Denmark ’ s wind industry is almost completely dependent on taxpayer subsidies , and Danes pay the highest electricity rates of any industrialized nation .
Several studies suggest that claims that one ##AT##-##AT## fifth of Denmark ’ s electricity demand is met by wind are an exaggeration , in part because much of the power is produced when there is no demand and must be sold to other countries .
The sorry state of wind and solar power shows the massive challenge that we face in trying to make today ’ s technology competitive and efficient .
Direct ##AT##-##AT## current lines need to be constructed to carry solar and wind energy from sunny , windy areas to where most people live .
Storage mechanisms need to be invented so that power is not interrupted whenever there is no sunshine or wind .
Proponents of carbon cuts argue that green ##AT##-##AT## energy technologies only seem more expensive , because the price of fossil fuels does not reflect the cost of their impact on the climate .
But allowing for this would make little difference .
The most comprehensive economic meta ##AT##-##AT## study shows that total future climate impacts would justify a tax of around € 0.01 per liter of petrol ( $ 0.06 per gallon in the United States ) – an amount dwarfed by the taxes already imposed by most European countries .
Despite the fact that changing from fossil fuels to green energy requires a total economic transformation , Denmark ’ s Climate Commission claimed that the price tag would be next to nothing .
The Commission reached this conclusion by assuming that the cost of not embracing its recommended policy would be massive .
The Commission believes that over the next four decades , fossil ##AT##-##AT## fuel costs will climb sharply , because sources will dry up and governments will place massive taxes on fossil fuels .
But this flies in the face of most evidence .
There is clearly plenty of cheap coal for hundreds of years , and with new cracking technology , gas is becoming more abundant .
Even oil supplies are likely to be significantly boosted by non ##AT##-##AT## conventional sources like tar sands .
By the same token , the prediction that governments will impose massive carbon taxes has little basis in reality .
Such assumptions seem like a poor framework on which to build significant public policy , and seem to ignore the substantial cost of eliminating fossil fuels , which is likely to amount to at least 5 % of GDP per year .
The shift away from fossil fuels will not be easy .
Policymakers must prioritize investment in green ##AT##-##AT## energy research and development .
Trying to force carbon cuts instead of investing first in research puts the cart before the horse .
Breakthroughs do not result automatically from a combination of taxes on fossil fuels and subsidies for present ##AT##-##AT## day green energy : despite the massive outlays associated with the Kyoto Protocol , participating countries ’ investment in R &amp; amp ; D as a percentage of GDP did not increase .
The change in message after the disaster of the Copenhagen summit was probably inevitable .
But the real change that is needed is the realization that drastic , early carbon cuts are a poor response to global warming – no matter how they are packaged .
It is an abiding conceit of our age that all good ideas go together .
Truth and reconciliation , peace and justice , even justice and truth : these are only some of the worthy ambitions for human society that are routinely presented as totally reconcilable .
But the stony reality is that it is by no means obvious that they are .
Of course , in societies that are basically in good shape , both psychologically and materially , such moral fables - such wishful thinking , really - rarely do much harm and can often do considerable good .
Think of the current multiculturalist fables that we in the West have concocted for ourselves in order to cope with the dilemmas and challenges of mass immigration from the non ##AT##-##AT## European world .
In this piece of inspired oversimplification , cultural &apos; diversity &apos; is invariably seen as a boon rather than a threat .
Yet one does not have to be a follower of Jorg Haider or the late Pim Fortuyn to know that , whatever the gains have been , whether in terms of economic growth or even the widening of cultural experience in the West , much has and is being lost .
At the very least , the national cultures of the major Western countries - their deep structures of ideology , taste , and aesthetics - are being changed , as new peoples , with new assumptions , demand that their sense of the world be taken into account .
Sometimes those changes can be for the worse .
Think , say , of how in much of Western Europe the only way that new immigrants and their host culture are reconciled is through a culture of consumption and materialism - that is , a culture of the lowest common denominator .
Still , it is preferable that this culture of the supermarket prevails , rather than one in which everyone &apos;s gods , habits , and beliefs are in perpetual conflict .
Although the moral and cultural simplifications of multiculturalism may have done the West little actual harm , the same cannot be said about poorer parts of the world .
For it is when &quot; First Worlders &quot; try to think about the plight of the poor , and , above all , about what can be done with regard to the Kosovos , the East Timors , the Afghanistans , and the Liberias of our planet , that thinking in happy over ##AT##-##AT## simplifications becomes dangerous . Dangerous to the people who are fated to live in desperately poor countries , or societies at war , or overwhelmed by refugees , or struck down by pandemics .
Specialists in human rights , conflict resolution , humanitarian relief , and democracy ##AT##-##AT## building tend to see themselves as coworkers striving toward a &apos; holistic &apos; solution , and those in need as requiring all those elements in their historical cure .
Reality is usually very different .
Take humanitarian action and human rights .
Most activists in these fields , not to mention their allies in private philanthropies and international organizations like the UN , believe that they need to work together - that humanitarian emergencies are the product of human rights crises and the former cannot be seriously addressed unless and until the latter are as well .
The stark truth , however , is that the moral imperatives of each activity are starkly different .
To put the matter crudely , the human rights activist is a moral absolutist par excellence .
He or she must uphold human rights standards , and , above all , human rights law to the letter or risk seeing the entire enterprise come unstuck .
In contrast , humanitarians are meliorists .
Their first job is to get the desperately ##AT##-##AT## needed aid that often they alone can deliver to populations in need and in danger .
In the absence of some military force to protect them ( in itself a mixed blessing , as interventions from Somalia to Bosnia demonstrated ) , these humanitarian groups must negotiate access with criminal warlords , oppressive governments , and war criminals .
In contrast to human rights activists , they cannot and must not be purists .
What is at stake here is far more than some easily resolved question about a division of labor .
A human rights activist may want to see an oppressive regime overthrown , may believe that this is the only long ##AT##-##AT## term solution .
A humanitarian , by contrast , may want to feed a population , knowing full well that food aid could strengthen the oppressive regime .
What takes place in the interface of human rights and humanitarianism is often the conflict of two rights .
So far , at least , those who wish for a better world , and who participate in the struggles for it either as activists or as sympathizers , have refused to face the tragic possibility that they will have to choose between good actions , and between moral imperatives .
Such reluctance is understandable , for the choice is almost like being forced to choose death over life .
Yet , as Africa burns , as the AIDS pandemic spreads , and as it becomes clearer that the material means at the disposal of those who ache for a better world do not match their moral aspirations , such choices will become more and more pressing .
The less willing we are to ask harsh questions about humanitarianism and human rights , peace and justice , truth and reconciliation , the longer we take refuge in self ##AT##-##AT## flattering fantasies about the fundamental reconcilability of all good efforts , the higher the cost will be when the moment of reckoning comes .
REYKJAVIK – No one yet has any real idea about when the global financial crisis will end , but one thing is certain : government budget deficits are headed into the stratosphere .
Investors in the coming years will need to be persuaded to hold mountains of new debt .
Although governments may try to cram public debt down the throats of local savers ( by using , for example , their rising influence over banks to force them to hold a disproportionate quantity of government paper ) , they will eventually find themselves having to pay much higher interest rates as well .
Within a couple years , interest rates on long ##AT##-##AT## term US Treasury notes could easily rise 3 ##AT##-##AT## 4 % , with interest rates on other governments ’ paper rising as much , or more .
Interest rates will rise to compensate investors both for having to accept a larger share of government bonds in their portfolio and for an increasing risk that governments will be tempted to inflate away the value of their debts , or even default .
In research that Carmen Reinhart and I have done on the history of financial crises , we find that public debt typically doubles , even adjusting for inflation , in the three years following a crisis .
Many nations , large and small , are now well on the way to meeting this projection .
China ’ s government has clearly indicated that it will use any means necessary to backstop growth in the face of a free fall in exports .
The Chinese have $ 2 trillion in hard currency reserves to back up their promise .
President Barack Obama ’ s new budget calls for a stunning $ 1.75 trillion deficit in the United States , a multiple of the previous record .
Even those countries that are not actively engaged in a fiscal orgy are seeing their surpluses collapse and their deficits soar , mainly in the face of falling tax revenues .
Indeed , few governments have submitted remotely realistic budget projections , typically relying on overly rosy economic scenarios .
Unfortunately , in 2009 , the global economy will not be a bed of roses .
Income in the US and euro ##AT##-##AT## area both appear to have declined at an annualized rate of roughly 6 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 ; Japan ’ s GDP fell at perhaps twice that rate .
China ’ s claim that its GDP grew at a 6 % rate , during the end of last year , is suspect .
Exports have collapsed throughout Asia , including Korea , Japan , and Singapore . Arguably India , and to a lesser extent Brazil , have been holding out a bit better .
But few emerging markets have reached a stage at which they can withstand a sustained collapse in the developed economies , much less serve as substitute engines of global growth .
With the credit crisis still making it difficult for many small and medium ##AT##-##AT## size businesses to obtain even the minimal level of financing necessary to maintain inventories and conduct trade , global GDP is on a precipice in 2009 .
There is a real possibility that global growth will register its first contraction since World War II .
In all likelihood , a slew of countries will see output declines of 4 ##AT##-##AT## 5 % in 2009 , with some. having true depression level drops , of 10 % or more .
Worse yet , unless financial systems spring back , growth could disappoint for years to come , especially in “ ground zero ” countries such as the United States , Britain , Ireland and Spain . US long ##AT##-##AT## term growth could be particularly dismal , as the Obama administration steers the country toward more European levels of welfare assistance and income redistribution ,
Countries with European ##AT##-##AT## style growth rates could handle debt obligations of 60 % of GDP when interest rates were low .
But , with debts in many countries rising to 80 % or 90 % of GDP , and with today ’ s low interest rates clearly a temporary phenomenon , trouble is brewing .
Many of the countries that are piling on massive quantities of debt to bail out their banks have only tepid medium term growth prospects , raising real questions of solvency and sustainability
Italy , for example with a debt ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## income ratio already exceeding 100 % , has been able to manage so far thanks to falling global rates .
But as debts mount , and global interest rates rise , investors will become rightly nervous about the risk of debt restructuring .
Other countries , such as Ireland , Britain , and the US , started with a much stronger fiscal position , but may not be much better off when the smoke clears .
Exchange rates are another wild card .
Asian central banks are still nervously clinging to the dollar . But with the US printing debt and money like it is going out of style , it would appear the euro is set to appreciate against the dollar two or three years down the road , if the euro is still around , that is .
As debt mounts and the recession lingers , we are surely going to see a number of governments trying to lighten their load through financial repression , higher inflation , partial default , or a combinations of all three .
Unfortunately , the endgame to the great recession of the 2000 ’ s will not be a pretty picture .
How much further will the dollar fall ?
Or has it already fallen so far that it will now start to move back to a higher level ?
For travelers to the United States from Europe or Asia , US prices are dramatically lower than at home .
A hotel room or dinner in New York seems a bargain when compared to prices in London , Paris , or Tokyo .
And shoppers from abroad are loading up on a wide range of products before heading home .
But , despite this very tangible evidence , it would be wrong to conclude that US goods are now so cheap at the existing exchange rate that the dollar must rise from its current level .
Although the goods and services that travelers buy may cost less in the US than abroad , the overall price of American products is still too high to erase the enormous trade imbalance between the US and the rest of the world .
To be sure , the falling dollar over the past few years has made American products more competitive and has caused the real value of US exports to rise sharply – by more than 25 % over the past three years .
But the trade deficit in 2007 nevertheless remained at more than $ 700 billion , or 5 % of GDP .
The large trade deficit and equally large current account deficit ( which includes net investment income ) implies that foreign investors must add $ 700 billion of US securities to their portfolios .
It is their unwillingness to do so at the existing exchange rate that causes the dollar to fall relative to other currencies .
In falling , the dollar lowers the value of the dollar securities in foreign portfolios when valued in euros or other home currencies , shrinking the share of dollars in investors ’ portfolios .
The weaker dollar also reduces the risk of future dollar decline , because it means that the dollar has to fall less in the future to shift the trade balance to a sustainable level .
But what is that sustainable level of the trade balance and of the dollar ?
While experts try to work this out in terms of portfolio balances , a more fundamental starting point is the fact that a US trade deficit means that Americans receive more goods and services from the rest of the world than they send back – $ 700 billion more last year . The difference was financed by transferring stocks and bonds worth $ 700 billion .
The interest and dividends on those securities will be paid by sending more “ pieces of paper ” .
And when those securities mature , they will be refinanced with new stocks and bonds .
It is unthinkable that the global economic system will continue indefinitely to allow the US to import more goods and services than it exports .
At some point , the US will need to start repaying the enormous amount that it has received from the rest of the world .
To do so , the US will need a trade surplus .
So the key determinant of the dollar ’ s long ##AT##-##AT## term value is that it must decline enough to shift the US trade balance from today ’ s deficit to a surplus .
That won ’ t happen anytime soon , but it is the direction in which the trade balance must continue to move .
And that means further depreciation of the dollar .
An important factor in this process will be the future price of oil and the extent of US dependence on oil imports .
In each of the past four years , the US imported 3.6 billion barrels of oil .
At the current price of more than $ 140 a barrel , that implies an import cost of more than $ 500 billion . The higher the cost of oil , the lower the dollar has to be to achieve any given reduction in the size of the trade deficit .
So a rising oil price as measured in euros or yen implies a greater dollar fall , and therefore an even higher oil price when stated in dollars .
There is one further important consideration in thinking about the future value of the dollar : relative inflation rates in the US and abroad . The US trade deficit depends on the real value of the dollar – that is , the value of the dollar adjusted for differences in price levels in the US and abroad .
If the US experiences higher inflation than our trading partners , the dollar ’ s nominal value must fall even further just to maintain the same real value .
The inflation differential between the dollar and the euro is now relatively small – only about one percentage point a year – but is greater relative to the yen and lower relative to the renminbi and other high ##AT##-##AT## inflation currencies . Over the longer run , however , inflation differentials could be a more significant force in determining the dollar ’ s path .
BERKELEY – The International Monetary Fund has been one of the few beneficiaries of the global economic crisis .
Just two years ago , it was being downsized , and serious people were asking whether it should be closed down .
Since then , there has been a renewed demand for IMF lending . Members have agreed to a tripling of its resources .
It has been authorized to raise additional funds by selling its own bonds .
The Fund is a beehive of activity .
But the crisis will not last forever . Meanwhile , the IMF ’ s critics have not gone away ; they have merely fallen silent temporarily .
The Fund only encourages their criticism by failing to define its role .
It needs to do so while it still has the world ’ s sympathetic ear .
The IMF ’ s first role is to assist countries that , as a result of domestic policies , experience balance ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## payments crises .
Their governments have no choice but to borrow from the Fund .
To safeguard its resources – that is , to be sure that its shareholders are paid back – the Fund must demand difficult policy adjustments on the part of these borrowers .
The problem is that the IMF has bought into the rhetoric of its critics by agreeing to “ streamline ” its conditionality .
In fact , where structural weaknesses are the source of problems , the Fund should still require structural adjustment as the price of its assistance .
By seeming to give ground on this point in the effort to win friends and influence people , the IMF has created unnecessary confusion .
A second role for the IMF is to act as a global reserve pool .
Countries have accumulated large reserves in order to insure against shocks .
This is costly for poor economies , which could better use the resources for investment and consumption .
Unfortunately , the recent demonstration of the volatility of global financial markets only encourages the tendency to stockpile reserves .
It would be more efficient to pool the reserves of countries that need them at different times .
The IMF has moved in this direction by creating a Short ##AT##-##AT## Term Liquidity Facility through which countries with strong policies can draw from the Fund up to five times their quota without conditionality .
But the STLF still requires a burdensome application process , which only Mexico , Colombia , and Poland have been willing to endure .
This made sense so long as the IMF ’ s resources were limited , as the application process allowed the Fund to limit its liability .
But , with the tripling of resources , this rationale no longer exists .
The IMF should categorically announce which countries qualify for the facility , automatically making them members of the pool .
A third role for the IMF is macro ##AT##-##AT## prudential supervisor .
Recent events have made clear that someone needs to anticipate and warn of risks to global financial stability .
The G ##AT##-##AT## 20 suggests that the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) , made up of national supervisory authorities , should take the lead in these tasks .
The Fund , through its early ##AT##-##AT## warning exercises and joint IMF ##AT##-##AT## World Bank Financial Sector Assessments , is to only play a supporting role .
But why the FSB should head up this process is far from clear .
The IMF , with its universal membership , is more representative , and it has a larger expert staff .
National supervisors may be reluctant to surrender this responsibility to a multilateral organization .
If so , this is shortsighted .
Financial markets and institutions with global reach need a global macro ##AT##-##AT## prudential regulator , not just a loosely organized college of supervisors .
Or it could be that national policymakers don ’ t trust the IMF , given that it essentially missed the global financial crisis .
If so , the Fund needs to win back their confidence .
This brings us to the IMF ’ s fourth role , namely using its bully pulpit to warn of risks created by large ##AT##-##AT## country policies .
Small countries are subject to market discipline , as any Latvian will tell you .
But when large economies whose currencies are used internationally need more resources , they can just print more money .
Not only do they feel less market discipline , but they are subject to less IMF discipline , since they are not compelled to borrow from the Fund .
But , as the sub ##AT##-##AT## prime mortgage debacle reminds us , large countries ’ policies can place the global financial system at risk .
The Fund , wary of biting the hand that feeds it , has been reluctant to issue strong warnings in such instances .
But if the IMF is to have a future , its management will have to issue stronger warnings about the next dangerously large US current ##AT##-##AT## account deficit , the next unsustainable housing boom , or whatever large ##AT##-##AT## country problem succeeds them .
There can be no more mincing of words .
Finally , the IMF needs to coordinate reform of the international system .
If , in the long run , a supra ##AT##-##AT## national unit , the Special Drawing Right , is to replace national currencies in international use , then the Fund will need to guide its development .
If stop ##AT##-##AT## gap measures are required during the transition , the Fund must provide leadership there as well .
So far , however , the innovative ideas for reforming the international system have come from the United Nations , 10 Downing Street , and the People ’ s Bank of China .
The Fund has been notable mainly for its silence .
The crisis is not yet forgotten , but the window is closing .
The next meeting of the IMF ’ s Board of Governors will be in early October in Istanbul .
If the Fund does not provide a clear vision of its future by then , the opportunity will have been missed .
PARIS &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; Everyone everywhere has by now heard about the “ clash of civilizations . ”
This Samuel Huntington concept has become universal .
In the 1950 ’ s , the French economist , Alfred Sauvy had a comparable success with the expression “ third world . ”
One reason these phrases gain wide acceptance is their lack of clear definition .
The “ clash of civilizations , ” basically the West against the rest , is supposed to describe the world as it is .
In reality , the West is vague enough to include a vast array of areas without describing their unifying characteristics .
So what exactly is West ?
What does Westernization mean ?
Why is Japan considered Western and China not ?
Where does Shanghai stand ?
Is Russia part of the West ?
From these uncertainties , we can conclude that the West is not a geographic entity .
It probably first established itself as a mindset when the Greeks , 25 centuries ago , perceived themselves as Western versus the Oriental Persians .
Since the West has lost any clear territorial basis since then , the phrase “ the West ” has become a universal not a local notion .
To be Western or Westernized , above all , is a mindset which does not coincide with any continent , nor with any specific nation or religion .
Huntington ’ s mistake , it seems , was to contain the West inside national borders : there is no map of the West .
No map can work when some Asian nations are Western ( Japan , Taiwan ) , when non ##AT##-##AT## Western groups ( Muslims in Europe ) live in supposedly Western countries , when some Eastern countries are partially Westernized and some Western countries ( Russia ) are not fully Westernized . Eventually it looks easier to define the mental borders of the West than its territorial borders .
I believe that the West is a mindset defined by three fundamental traits that cannot easily be found in the so ##AT##-##AT## called Eastern civilizations : a passion for innovation , a capacity for self ##AT##-##AT## criticism , and gender equality .
‘ What is new ? ’ &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; a personal greeting since the Hellenistic age – captures the essence of the Western mind .
The non ##AT##-##AT## Westerner , however , would rather place tradition above innovation .
But innovation as a fundamental value explains the scientific breakthroughs of the West versus the East . It explains unavoidable conflicts with conservative non ##AT##-##AT## Western societies and it also explains what we should call ‘ the Westernization of the West . ’
The West keeps destroying its own traditions , including its religions . The economist Joseph Schumpeter defined this process as one of “ creative destruction . ”
The term could be applied to all walks of life in the West .
Western conservatives are no less prone to creative destruction than Western liberals : conservatives , indeed , are well known for inventing traditions . Take the 19th century British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli , who invented most of the supposedly ancient traditions around the British monarchy .
Innovation in the West seems to be a never ##AT##-##AT## ending , self ##AT##-##AT## transforming process .
Self ##AT##-##AT## criticism , even more than innovation , is a defining characteristic of the West .
In most if not all non ##AT##-##AT## Western civilizations , pride and self love exclude self ##AT##-##AT## criticism or at least the criticism of one ’ s civilization as such .
A true Muslim or Chinese scholar cannot be defined as a true Chinese or a true Muslim by being critical of his own world .
Not so in the West .
The Western scholar remains perfectly legitimate when putting to death Western values : there is no Chinese or Muslim Nietzsche claiming that his own God is dead .
Is there a Chinese or a Muslim Montaigne ready to write that the “ Indian savages ” may be wiser than us , as Montaigne did in 16th century France ?
Of course there must be some Chinese or Muslim Montaigne or Nietzsche , but they would not be considered beacons of their civilizations .
Self ##AT##-##AT## criticism , not self ##AT##-##AT## love , and cultural relativism are the nuts and bolts of the Western mindset .
The same goes with gender equality .
This has not always been so . In the ancient Greek , Jewish , and Christian religions , women were perceived as inferior to men .
But this notion has been contentious in the West for centuries . Nowadays , gender equality has become the norm .
This is not the case in most non ##AT##-##AT## Western civilizations .
Some would argue that gender equality is a consequence of the modernization process , not of Westernization .
This may be true , but the status of women is clearly one issue that puts non ##AT##-##AT## Western Muslims into opposition to the West .
If we accept the above definition of the West as a mindset , this leaves open three major questions : can the East be modernized without being Westernized ?
Where do we draw the line between West and East ?
Will the West remain Western ?
So far , there is no case in history of non ##AT##-##AT## Western modernization ; the discourse on Asian values , initially started in Singapore , is basically a political discourse .
It is after retooling their mindset towards innovation and self ##AT##-##AT## criticism that Asian countries have become modern .
This does not make them less Asian .
Contemporary Koreans or Japanese remain fully Korean or Japanese but are closer to a Westerner than they would be to their own ancestors .
Similarly , a modern Egyptian or a modern Saudi will be more on par with a French or an American than they would be with an ancient Arab .
Does this Westernization make the Egyptian or the Saudi less authentic Arabs ?
Such a debate does take place within all Eastern societies , which leads us to the real clash of civilizations : all societies today are fragmented between Westernizers and non ##AT##-##AT## Westernizers .
This clash within civilizations on what modernization means is more significant than Huntington ’ s alleged conflict between geographical entities .
The controversy on the essential meaning of modernization , also known as an identity crisis , does impact Western countries as well .
Vast groups who live in the West , Western and non ##AT##-##AT## Western fundamentalists , fight the unending Westernization process in the name of tradition .
Many would like to stop the engine by using various guises like ecology or identity , but a Western society where you could not start your day by asking ‘ What &apos;s new ? ’ would not be Western any more .
The world ’ s economic powers finally appear to be closing ranks behind efforts to address global poverty and economic underdevelopment .
At this year ’ s World Economic Forum , within the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 , and elsewhere , the consensus that something needs to be done has been as clear and as it is welcome .
But , for some of the world ’ s poorest regions , particularly Sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan Africa ( SSA ) , a commitment to help may not be enough .
Basic indicators of economic and social development show SSA lagging far behind other developing areas .
The average income per capita of SSA countries in 2000 was less than half that for all developing countries , about 40 % of the level of East Asian and Pacific developing countries , and less than 25 % that of Latin America and the Caribbean countries .
Similarly , life expectancy at birth in SSA countries lagged 16 years behind the developing ##AT##-##AT## country average , 14 years behind countries in South Asia , and 21 years behind countries in East Asia , Latin America , and the Caribbean .
In combined gross enrolment in primary , secondary and higher education , SSA countries stood 19 % below the average for developing countries , 11 % below South Asian countries , 29 % below East Asia and the Pacific , and 32 % below Latin America and the Caribbean .
What accounts for this broad ##AT##-##AT## based underdevelopment ?
Until the late 1800 ’ s , most of Africa was unexplored and occupied by hunter ##AT##-##AT## gatherers and practitioners of subsistence agriculture .
Land was relatively abundant and allocated by tribal chiefs without regard to Western ##AT##-##AT## style property rights .
The only territorial units resembling those that exist today were Ethiopia , Liberia , and South Africa .
During the burst of imperial expansion in Africa that followed national integration and trade liberalization in Europe , colonial powers showed little interest in delineating colonial national boundaries based on cultural or ethnic considerations ; they cared only about raw materials and markets .
The Berlin Conference of 1885 fixed the borders of Europe ’ s African colonies so that they included within them a large variety of languages , religions , and ethnic groups .
Most SSA countries attained national independence some time after the end of the Second World War , as the British , French , Belgian , and Portuguese empires unraveled ( Germany had already lost its colonies after 1918 ) .
Thus , SSA countries have only enjoyed independence for a short period in comparison with , say , South America , where countries had their wars of independence around 1810 ##AT##-##AT## 1820 and achieved some type of constitutional government by 1850 ##AT##-##AT## 1880 .
The legacy of arbitrarily drawn borders and limited political centralization meant that in many SSA countries remnants of the colonial experience continue to play a big role in defining the institutional landscape , such as the civil service and public administration , educational system , and economic infrastructure .
To be sure , many countries adopted English , French , or Portuguese as their official languages , and European missionaries , who often followed in the colonizers ’ footsteps , had success in transmitting their religious practices to local populations .
Nevertheless , linguistic variety and ethnic divisions remain more important than in most of the developing world , and tribal affiliation has continued to hinder the emergence of unifying national identities .
Moreover , self ##AT##-##AT## rule has not brought many democratically elected regimes .
Instead , anti ##AT##-##AT## colonial liberation leaders often developed personality cults and hogged power for decades .
Monopolization of political power led , in turn , to rampant cronyism and corruption , which stifled economic and social development .
Recent data on perceived corruption in public transactions show the SSA countries with the lowest average score for all developing regions .
Only Botswana and Namibia achieved respectable scores , while the worst offenders were Cameroon , Uganda , Kenya , Angola , Madagascar , and Nigeria .
Weak national unity has underpinned an even more damaging pattern .
Since the 1990 ’ s , many of the world ’ s armed conflicts have taken place in SSA countries .
Congo and Lesotho each experienced two conflicts during the decade , while civil strife ravaged Sierra Leone , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Congo , and Sudan .
This deterred not only foreign and domestic investment , but , more fundamentally , the formation of the very institutions needed for successful economic development .
Sustained economic growth requires , everywhere , the accumulation of physical and human capital , as well as the acquisition of technological capabilities .
This process does not occur in a historical vacuum , devoid of the influence of powerful social and political factors . Structure , institutions , and policies are critical determinants , as is the availability of qualified technical and administrative personnel .
Indeed , the availability of a highly qualified bureaucracy in both South Korea and Taiwan – and before that in their model country , Japan – was a necessary precondition for achieving rapid economic growth .
By contrast , the shortage in SSA of scientific , technical , and administrative skills , such as those of engineers , natural scientists , managers , and technicians , is a key reason why the East Asian “ miracle ” could not be reproduced there .
None of the preconditions of economic development will be met in SSA until the legacy of colonialism and weak states that has defined the region is overcome .
Developed countries can provide limited help by means of well ##AT##-##AT## focused , untied aid and technical assistance projects .
But success depends mainly on the emergence of dedicated , talented , and honest national and regional political leaders .
Only such leaders can build up the legitimacy needed to unite their countries , and only then will they be able to confront head on the many challenges that the region faces in shaking loose from the shackles of backwardness .
People all over the world react with visceral horror to attacks on civilians by Al Quaeda , by Palestinian suicide bombers , by Basque or Chechen separatists , or by IRA militants .
As there now seems to be a pause in the spate of suicide bombings and other terrorist acts--if only momentary--perhaps now is a moment to grapple with a fundamental question : What makes terrorist killings any more worthy of condemnation than other forms of murder ?
The special opprobrium associated with the word &quot; terrorism &quot; must be understood as a condemnation of means , not ends .
Of course , those who condemn terrorist attacks on civilians often also reject the ends that the attackers are trying to achieve .
They think that a separate Basque state , or the withdrawal of US forces from the Middle East , for example , are not aims that anyone should be pursuing , let alone by violent means .
But the condemnation does not depend on rejecting the aims of the terrorists .
The reaction to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 on New York and Washington and their like underscores that such means are outrageous whatever the end ; they should not be used to achieve even a good end--indeed , even if there is no other way to achieve it .
The normal balancing of costs against benefits is not allowable here .
This claim is not as simple as it appears because it does not depend on a general moral principle forbidding all killing of non ##AT##-##AT## combatants .
Similarly , those who condemn terrorism as beyond the pale are usually not pacifists .
They believe not only that it is all right to kill soldiers and bomb munitions depots in times of war , but that inflicting &quot; collateral damage &quot; on non ##AT##-##AT## combatants it is sometimes unavoidable--and morally permissible .
But if that is permissible , why is it wrong to aim directly at non ##AT##-##AT## combatants if killing them will have a good chance of inducing the enemy to cease hostilities , withdraw from occupied territory , or grant independence ?
Dying is bad , however one is killed .
So why should a civilian death be acceptable if it occurs as a side ##AT##-##AT## effect of combat that serves a worthy end , whereas a civilian death that is inflicted deliberately as a means to the same end is a terrorist outrage ?
The distinction is not universally accepted--certainly not by the major belligerents in World War II .
Hiroshima is the most famous example of terror bombing , but the Germans , the Japanese , and the British as well as the Americans deliberately slaughtered civilian non ##AT##-##AT## combatants in large numbers .
Today , however , terrorism inspires widespread revulsion , which in turn helps to justify military action against it .
So it is essential that the reason for that revulsion become better understood .
The core moral idea is a prohibition against aiming at the death of a harmless person .
Everyone is presumed to be inviolable in this way until he himself becomes a danger to others ; so we are permitted to kill in self ##AT##-##AT## defense , and to attack enemy combatants in war .
But this is an exception to a general and strict requirement of respect for human life .
So long as we are not doing any harm , no one may kill us just because it would be useful to do so .
This minimal basic respect is owed to every individual , and it may not be violated even to achieve valuable long ##AT##-##AT## term goals .
However there are some activities , including legitimate self ##AT##-##AT## defense or warfare , that create an unavoidable risk of harm to innocent parties .
This is true not only of violent military or police actions but also of peaceful projects like major construction in densely populated cities .
In those cases , if the aim is important enough , the activity is not morally prohibited provided due care is taken to minimize the risk of harm to innocent parties , consistent with the achievement of the aim .
The moral point is that we are obliged to do our best to avoid or minimize civilian casualties in warfare , even if we know that we cannot avoid them completely .
Those deaths do not violate the strictest protection of human life--that we may not aim to kill a harmless person .
On the contrary , our aim is if possible to avoid such collateral deaths .
Of course , the victim ends up dead whether killed deliberately by a terrorist or regrettably as the side effect of an attack on a legitimate military target .
But in our sense of what we are owed morally by our fellow human beings , there is a huge difference between these two acts , and the attitudes they express toward human life .
So long as it remains an effective means for weak parties to exert pressure on their more powerful enemies , terrorism cannot be expected to disappear .
But we should hope nonetheless that the recognition of its special form of contempt for humanity will spread , rather than being lost as a result of its recent successes .
NEW YORK – The global economy ends 2010 more divided than it was at the beginning of the year .
On one side , emerging ##AT##-##AT## market countries like India , China , and the Southeast Asian economies , are experiencing robust growth . On the other side , Europe and the United States face stagnation – indeed , a Japanese ##AT##-##AT## style malaise – and stubbornly high unemployment .
The problem in the advanced countries is not a jobless recovery , but an anemic recovery – or worse , the possibility of a double ##AT##-##AT## dip recession .
This two ##AT##-##AT## track world poses some unusual risks .
While Asia ’ s economic output is too small to pull up growth in the rest of the world , it may be enough to push up commodity prices .
Meanwhile , US efforts to stimulate its economy through the Federal Reserve ’ s policy of “ quantitative easing ” may backfire .
After all , in globalized financial markets , money looks for the best prospects around the world , and these prospects are in Asia , not the US . So the money won ’ t go where it ’ s needed , and much of it will wind up where it ’ s not wanted – causing further increases in asset and commodity prices , especially in emerging markets .
Given the high levels of excess capacity and unemployment in Europe and America , quantitative easing is unlikely to trigger a bout of inflation .
It could , however , increase anxieties about future inflation , leading to higher long ##AT##-##AT## term interest rates – precisely the opposite of the Fed ’ s goal .
This is not the only , or even the most important , downside risk facing the global economy .
The gravest threat comes from the wave of austerity sweeping the world , as governments , particularly in Europe , confront the large deficits brought on by the Great Recession , and as anxieties about some countries ’ ability to meet their debt payments contributes to financial ##AT##-##AT## market instability .
The outcome of premature fiscal consolidation is all but foretold : growth will slow , tax revenues will diminish , and the reduction in deficits will be disappointing .
And , in our globally integrated world , the slowdown in Europe will exacerbate the slowdown in the US , and vice versa .
With the US able to borrow at record ##AT##-##AT## low interest rates , and with the promise of high returns on public investments after a decade of neglect , it is clear what it should do .
A large ##AT##-##AT## scale public ##AT##-##AT## investment program would stimulate employment in the short term , and growth in the long term , leading in the end to a lower national debt .
But financial markets demonstrated their shortsightedness in the years preceding the crisis , and are doing so once again , by applying pressure for spending cuts , even if that implies reducing badly needed public investments .
Moreover , political gridlock will ensure that little is done about the other festering problems confronting the American economy : mortgage foreclosures are likely to continue unabated ( legal complications aside ) ; small and medium ##AT##-##AT## sized enterprises are likely to continue to be starved of funds ; and the small and medium ##AT##-##AT## sized banks that traditionally provide them with credit are likely to continue to struggle to survive .
In Europe , meanwhile , matters are unlikely to be any better .
Europe has finally managed to come to the rescue of Greece and Ireland .
In the run up to the crisis , both were governed by right ##AT##-##AT## wing governments marked by crony capitalism or worse , demonstrating once again that free ##AT##-##AT## market economics didn ’ t work in Europe any better than it did in the US .
In Greece , as in the US , a new government was left to clean up the mess .
The Irish government that encouraged reckless bank lending and the creation of a property bubble was , perhaps not surprisingly , no more adept in managing the economy after the crisis that it was before .
Politics aside , property bubbles leave in their wake a legacy of debt and excess capacity in real estate that is not easily rectified – especially when politically connected banks resist restructuring mortgages .
To me , attempting to discern the economic prospects for 2011 is not a particularly interesting question : the answer is bleak , with little upside potential and a lot of downside risk .
More importantly , how long will it take Europe and America to recover , and can Asia ’ s seemingly export ##AT##-##AT## dependent economies continue to grow if their historical markets languish ?
My best bet is that these countries will maintain rapid growth as they shift their economic focus to their vast and untapped domestic markets .
This will require considerable restructuring of their economies , but China and India are both dynamic , and proved their resilience in their response to the Great Recession .
I am not so bullish on Europe and America .
In both cases , the underlying problem is insufficient aggregate demand .
The ultimate irony is that there are simultaneously excess capacity and vast unmet needs – and policies that could restore growth by using the former to address the latter .
Both the US and Europe , for instance , must retrofit their economies to address the challenges of global warming .
There are feasible policies that would work within long ##AT##-##AT## term budget constraints .
The problem is politics : in the US , the Republican Party would rather see President Barack Obama fail than the economy succeed .
In Europe , 27 countries with different interests and perspectives are pulling in different directions , without enough solidarity to compensate .
The bailout packages are , in this light , impressive achievements .
In both Europe and America , the free ##AT##-##AT## market ideology that allowed asset bubbles to grow unfettered – markets always know best , so government must not intervene – now ties policymakers ’ hands in designing effective responses to the crisis .
One might have thought that the crisis itself would undermine confidence in that ideology .
Instead , it has resurfaced to drag governments and economies down the sinkhole of austerity .
If politics is the problem in Europe and America , only political changes are likely to restore them to growth .
Or else they can wait until the overhang of excess capacity diminishes , capital goods become obsolete , and the economy ’ s internal restorative forces work their gradual magic .
Either way , victory is not around the corner .
PRINCETON – Barack Obama worked for three years as a community organizer on Chicago ’ s blighted South Side , so he knows all about the real poverty that exists in America .
He knows that in one of the world ’ s richest nations , 37 million people live in poverty , a far higher proportion than in Europe ’ s wealthy nations .
Yet Obama ’ s campaigning has focused on “ Main Street ” and tax cuts for the middle class , bypassing the issue of what to do about poverty .
It ’ s not as if Obama has no policies for helping the poor .
Go to his Web site , click on “ The Issues ” and then on “ Poverty . ”
There you will find a set of thoughtful proposals ranging from raising the minimum wage to establishing model “ Promise Neighborhoods ” that will attempt to turn around areas with high levels of poverty and low levels of educational achievement by providing services such as early childhood education and crime prevention .
( Go to John McCain ’ s Web site , and you won ’ t even find “ poverty ” among the list of issues to click on – although “ Space Program ” is there . )
So why isn ’ t Obama speaking up about an issue on which he has so much more first ##AT##-##AT## hand experience than his opponent , and better policies , too ?
Perhaps not enough of the poor vote , or they will vote Democratic anyway .
Moreover , his researchers presumably have told him that independent middle ##AT##-##AT## class voters are more likely to be won over by appeals to their wallets than to concern for America ’ s poor .
If America ’ s poor don ’ t rank high among voters ’ concerns , it is no surprise that the poor abroad are virtually invisible .
Again , Obama has both the background – with his family ties to Kenya – and a promising policy , to increase America ’ s foreign assistance to $ 50 billion by 2012 , using the money to stabilize failing states and bring sustainable growth to Africa .
( Currently , of all the OECD donor nations , only Greece gives a lower percentage of its gross national income than the United States does . )
But when Obama ’ s running mate , Joe Biden , was asked , in his debate with his Republican counterpart , Sarah Palin , what proposals an Obama ##AT##-##AT## Biden administration might have to scale back as a result of the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout , the only specific proposal he mentioned was the increase in foreign assistance .
McCain has never gotten down to specifics about how much foreign aid he would like the US to give .
Both candidates refer to deaths of American military personnel in Iraq , but there has been less attention to the war ’ s civilian causalities .
In her debate with Biden , Palin actually attacked Obama for saying that , in her words , “ All we ’ re doing in Afghanistan is air ##AT##-##AT## raiding villages and killing civilians . ” She called that comment “ reckless ” and “ untrue , ” because , “ That ’ s not what we ’ re doing there .
We ’ re fighting terrorists , and we ’ re securing democracy . ”
Of course , killing civilians is not all that the US and its NATO allies are doing in Afghanistan , and if Obama implied that it was , his rhetoric was careless .
But what is extraordinary about Palin ’ s comment is that , despite being a strong proponent of the sanctity of human life , in criticizing Obama she did not pause to deplore the serious loss of innocent human life that American air strikes in Afghanistan have caused .
Afghanistan ’ s president , Hamid Karzai , has repeatedly expressed outrage at American air strikes that have killed civilians – most recently in August , when he said that 95 Afghans , including 50 children , were killed in the bombing of a village .
The global ethical challenge that has been most prominent in the campaign is climate change .
Here , the candidates ’ goals are virtually identical : they both support a cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade system to make deep cuts in US greenhouse ##AT##-##AT## gas emissions by 2050 .
Obama wants the goal to be an 80 % reduction and McCain says 66 % , but , since the next president will leave office no later than 2016 , that difference is irrelevant .
Interestingly , one ethical issue on which neither candidate has campaigned has been shown to have the potential to move voters .
A group called Defenders of Wildlife has been running an ad graphically highlighting Palin ’ s support for shooting wolves from aircraft .
A study of Republicans , Democrats , and independents showed that viewing the ad led to greater support for Obama .
According to Glenn Kessler , the head of HCD research , which conducted the study with the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion , whereas recent ads from both parties have had little impact among voters , “ This is the first ad in over a month that seems to have broken through . ”
Consistent with that finding , an historic ballot initiative in California to ban cruel forms of animal confinement on factory farms , including the battery cage system of keeping hens , is also showing strong support .
China ’ s remarkable growth has been financed recently by a rapid expansion of money and bank credit that is producing an increasingly unsustainable investment boom .
This renews concerns that the country may not be able to avert a replay of the painful boom – and ##AT##-##AT## bust cycle such as the one it endured in the mid ##AT##-##AT## 1990 ’ s .
Monetary policy is usually the first line of defense in such situations .
But China ’ s monetary policy has been hamstrung by the tightly managed exchange ##AT##-##AT## rate regime . This regime prevents the central bank – the People ’ s Bank of China ( PBC ) – from taking appropriate policy decisions to manage domestic demand , because interest ##AT##-##AT## rate hikes could encourage capital inflows and put further pressure on the exchange rate .
There is , of course , a vigorous ongoing debate about China ’ s exchange ##AT##-##AT## rate policy .
China ’ s rising trade surplus has led some observers to call for a revaluation of the renminbi to correct what they see as an unfair competitive advantage that China maintains in international markets .
Others argue that the stable exchange rate fosters macroeconomic stability in China .
But this debate misses the point .
What China really needs is a truly independent monetary policy oriented to domestic objectives .
This would enable the PBC to manage domestic demand by allowing interest rates to rise in order to rein in credit growth and deter reckless investment .
An independent monetary policy requires a flexible exchange rate , not a revaluation .
But what could take the place of the stable exchange rate as an anchor for monetary policy and for tying down inflation expectations ?
We recommend a low inflation objective as the anchor for monetary policy in China .
Theoretical research and the practical experiences of many countries both show that focusing on price stability is the best way for monetary policy to achieve the broader objectives in the charter of the PBC : macroeconomic and financial stability , high employment growth , etc . The low inflation objective need not involve the formalities of an inflation ##AT##-##AT## targeting regime , such as that practiced by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England , and is similar in approach to that recommended for the United States by US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
How could such a framework be operated effectively in an economy in which financial sector problems have weakened the monetary transmission mechanism ?
This is a key concern because , notwithstanding recent reforms , the banking system remains fragile .
Nevertheless , we believe that a minimal set of financial sector reforms – essentially making banks ’ balance sheets strong enough to withstand substantial interest ##AT##-##AT## rate policy actions – should suffice to implement a low inflation objective .
Although full modernization of the financial sector is a long way off even in the best of circumstances , the minimal reforms that we recommend could strengthen the banking system sufficiently in the near term to support a more flexible exchange rate anchored by an inflation objective .
Indeed , price stability , and the broader macroeconomic stability emanating from it , would provide a good foundation for pushing forward with other financial sector reforms .
The framework we suggest has the important benefit of continuity .
The PBC would not have to change its operational approach to monetary policy .
Only a shift in strategic focus would be needed to anchor monetary policy with a long ##AT##-##AT## run target range for low inflation .
Monitoring of monetary ( and credit ) targets would still be important in achieving the inflation objective .
Furthermore , it should be easier to adopt the new framework when times are good – like now , when growth is strong and inflation is low .
There is some risk that appreciation of the exchange rate if greater flexibility were allowed could precipitate deflation .
What this really highlights , however , is the importance of framing the debate about exchange ##AT##-##AT## rate flexibility in a broader context .
Having an independent monetary policy that could counteract boom ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## bust cycles would be the best way for China to deal with such risks .
Contrary to those who regard the discussion of an alternative monetary framework as premature , there are good reasons for China to begin right now to build the institutional foundation for the transition to an independent monetary policy .
Indeed , early adoption of a low inflation objective would help secure the monetary and financial stability that China needs as it allows greater exchange ##AT##-##AT## rate flexibility .
CHICAGO – In an interesting recent book , What Money Can ’ t Buy : The Moral Limits of the Market , the Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel points to the range of things that money can buy in modern societies and gently tries to stoke our outrage at the market ’ s growing dominance .
Is he right that we should be alarmed ?
While Sandel worries about the corrupting nature of some monetized transactions ( do kids really develop a love of reading if they are bribed to read books ? ) , he is also concerned about unequal access to money , which makes trades using money inherently unequal .
More generally , he fears that the expansion of anonymous monetary exchange erodes social cohesion , and argues for reducing money ’ s role in society .
Sandel ’ s concerns are not entirely new , but his examples are worth reflecting upon .
In the United States , some companies pay the unemployed to stand in line for free public tickets to congressional hearings .
They then sell the tickets to lobbyists and corporate lawyers who have a business interest in the hearing but are too busy to stand in line .
Clearly , public hearings are an important element of participatory democracy .
All citizens should have equal access .
So selling access seems to be a perversion of democratic principles .
The fundamental problem , though , is scarcity .
We cannot accommodate everyone in the room who might have an interest in a particularly important hearing .
So we have to “ sell ” entry .
We can either allow people to use their time ( standing in line ) to bid for seats , or we can auction seats for money .
The former seems fairer , because all citizens seemingly start with equal endowments of time .
But is a single mother with a high ##AT##-##AT## pressure job and three young children as equally endowed with spare time as a student on summer vacation ?
And is society better off if she , the chief legal counsel for a large corporation , spends much of her time standing in line ?
Whether it is better to sell entry tickets for time or for money thus depends on what we hope to achieve .
If we want to increase society ’ s productive efficiency , people ’ s willingness to pay with money is a reasonable indicator of how much they will gain if they have access to the hearing .
Auctioning seats for money makes sense – the lawyer contributes more to society by preparing briefs than by standing in line .
On the other hand , if it is important that young , impressionable citizens see how their democracy works , and that we build social solidarity by making corporate executives stand in line with jobless teenagers , it makes sense to force people to bid with their time and to make entry tickets non ##AT##-##AT## transferable .
But if we think that both objectives – efficiency and solidarity – should play some role , perhaps we should turn a blind eye to hiring the unemployed to stand in line in lieu of busy lawyers , so long as they do not corner all of the seats .
What about the sale of human organs , another example Sandel worries about ?
Something seems wrong when a lung or a kidney is sold for money .
Yet we celebrate the kindness of a stranger who donates a kidney to a young child .
So , clearly , it is not the transfer of the organ that outrages us – we do not think that the donor is misinformed about the value of a kidney or is being fooled into parting with it .
Nor , I think , do we have concerns about the scruples of the person selling the organ – after all , they are parting irreversibly with something that is dear to them for a price that few of us would accept .
I think part of our discomfort has to do with the circumstances in which the transaction takes place .
What kind of society do we live in if people have to sell their organs to survive ?
But , while a ban on organ sales may make us feel better , does it really make society better off ?
Possibly , if it makes society work harder to ensure that people are never driven to the circumstances that would make them contemplate selling a vital organ .
But possibly not , if it allows society to ignore the underlying problem , either moving the trade underground , or forcing people in such circumstances to resort to worse remedies .
Then again , part of our unease probably has to do with what we perceive as an unequal exchange .
The seller is giving up part of her body in an irreversible transaction .
The buyer is giving up only money – perhaps earned on a lucky stock trade or at an overpaid job .
If that money had been earned by selling a portion of a lung , or represented savings painfully accumulated during years of backbreaking work , we might consider the exchange more equal .
Of course , the central virtue of money is precisely its anonymity .
I need know nothing about the dollar bill I receive to be able to use it .
But , because money ’ s anonymity obscures its provenance , it may be socially less acceptable as a medium of payment for some objects .
In both examples – congressional tickets and organ sales – Sandel suggests reducing money ’ s role .
But money has many virtues in facilitating transactions – hence its ubiquitous use .
So , perhaps the more important message is that society ’ s tolerance for monetization is proportional to the legitimacy accorded to the distribution of money .
The more people believe that it is the hardworking and the deserving who have money , the more they are willing to tolerate transactions for money ( though some transactions remain beyond the pale ) .
But if people believe that the moneyed are primarily those who are well connected or crooked , their tolerance for monetary transactions falls .
Rather than focusing on prohibiting monetary transactions , perhaps a more important lesson imparted by Sandel ’ s examples is that we should work continuously to improve the perceived legitimacy of money ’ s distribution .
The withdrawal of Israeli troops and the evacuation of Jewish settlers from Gaza , after 38 years of occupation , is the most recent proof of the limits of military power , even when that power is overwhelming .
Now is the time to take stock of the lessons learned from the years of occupation and resistance in order to understand what Israelis and Palestinians should do next .
To begin with , it is imperative to understand how much credit Palestinians can credibly claim for the Israeli withdrawal .
True , Palestinian resistance and sacrifices were a contributing factor in Ariel Sharon ’ s decision to reverse a policy he had espoused for decades .
But it would be a mistake to attribute the Israeli withdrawal exclusively to Palestinian militancy .
After all , this bittersweet Israeli action was neither a clear result of military defeat nor a consequence of political negotiations .
But unilateralism is not a rational long ##AT##-##AT## term and effective policy , for it will not lead to a genuine and lasting peace in the Middle East .
Just as President Bush has discovered in Iraq , Sharon will also be forced to acknowledge the limits of his strategy .
Unilateralism seems very expedient to shortsighted politicians , for it obviates the need for what they perceive as the mess of actual negotiations – that is , meeting their counterparts face to face and discovering the human results of their policies .
Going it alone also seems politically advantageous domestically , because leaders can decide how much and how far they want to carry out a particular policy .
To be fair , unilateralism is convenient not only for a reluctant Israeli prime minister who does not wish to make substantial compromises during negotiations ; it is also attractive to hard ##AT##-##AT## line Palestinians who regard multilateralism as a means of pressing them to make unpopular concessions .
In any case , the day after the completion of the Gaza withdrawal , Israelis and Palestinians will be confronted with important unresolved questions .
There is no doubt that the evacuation of Jewish settlers in areas that Israelis consider part of their God ##AT##-##AT## given territory represents a huge ideological reversal .
But after years of preaching and practicing one of Zionism ’ s main tenets , will the removal of settlements continue in the West Bank , or will this be a one ##AT##-##AT## time exception ?
Palestinians , for their part , will be expected to answer questions – in deeds , not just in words – about their ability to build a modern pluralistic state .
How will the Palestinian body politic deal with the growing power of the Islamic movements that undoubtedly will expect a significant share of power in post ##AT##-##AT## withdrawal Gaza ?
The international community also will have to answer some key questions . According to the Palestinian Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development ( PECDAR ) , annual per capita income in Gaza continues to average roughly $ 700 , while Israelis enjoy incomes averaging a $ 16,000 per capita .
In the absence of relatively well ##AT##-##AT## paying jobs , what will happen to the lines of unemployed Gazans ? The potential flight of employment seekers – a formidable force worldwide – is only one problem .
More immediately , if Gazan families are not well fed , the recurrence of cross ##AT##-##AT## border violence , if not the eruption of a third intifada , will only be a matter of time .
While the economic situation in Gaza is a critical issue , the future of the Palestinian ##AT##-##AT## Israeli conflict will be determined mainly by the next steps in the peace process .
Permanent ##AT##-##AT## status issues concerning borders , the West Bank , Jerusalem , and refugees must be dealt with bilaterally .
Any serious observer of the Palestinian ##AT##-##AT## Israeli conflict will no doubt acknowledge that there can be no unilateral solution to these issues .
As for the peace process ’ s multilateral guarantors , the United States and its quartet partners – the European Union , the United Nations , and Russia – have failed to provide even the most basic facts regarding Israel ’ s withdrawal or how it relates to the “ road map ” agreed in 2003 .
They cannot continue to sit on the sidelines . Washington ’ s quixotic decision to call Israel ’ s unilateral move part of the road map has failed to convince many Palestinians .
The prevailing opinion among Palestinians is that the road map will be put into deep freeze once the Israelis complete their Gaza withdrawal .
But the Palestinian and Israeli peoples , their leaders , and the international community must all respond to the challenges that will follow .
Most importantly , the future of the conflict and the chances for genuine peace in the region will depend on understanding the limits of offensive military power , defensive resistance , and unilateralism .
Serious face ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## face talks , in accordance to international law and with the help of the international community , are the only way forward .
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s proposal for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and part of the West Bank has been overwhelmingly defeated by a referendum within his own party , Likud , in what seems to be a humiliating defeat .
Yet this is likely to have little or no effect on Sharon &apos;s intention to carry through with the plan .
At first , this seems surprising , since he said before the referendum that he would abide by its outcome .
But Sharon is 75 years old and probably within two years of retirement .
He is determined that his plan becomes his political legacy .
Since there is no precedent for a party referendum , he can argue that the vote does not bind him .
Moreover , Sharon made sure that his main political rivals - notably former Prime Minister Benjamin ( Bibi ) Netanyahu - supported his plan .
They are now in no position to challenge him as the champions of the opposition within Likud .
So while some members may walk out , Sharon can easily hold on to control of the party .
In addition , many Sharon supporters , torn by what they saw as the plan &apos;s combination of costs and benefits , stayed home or even voted against it , but still want Sharon as their leader .
But Sharon is prepared to go even further in taking political risks to push through the withdrawal .
Small right ##AT##-##AT## wing parties in his coalition have already announced that his determination to do so will make them walk out of the government .
Sharon will then turn to the leader of the opposition , 80 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old former prime minister Shimon Peres , to form a national unity government .
And Peres is ready to do so .
The passionate debate stirred up by Sharon &apos;s plan shows how truly revolutionary his proposal is .
Having the army uproot Jewish settlements - with inevitable scenes of settlers resisting and being dragged off - will be a traumatic event for the country .
The plan also entails considerable strategic risks , which , probably more than the prospect of uprooted settlements , account for the large &quot; no &quot; by Likud members .
A key concern is the precedent of withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000 .
Today , most Israelis believe that this step , though justified on strategic grounds in the face of constant attacks by the Lebanese group Hizbollah , convinced Palestinians that violence worked .
In the same manner , a withdrawal from Gaza , many people worry , will bring increased anarchy there and a rise in overall terrorist attacks .
But convinced - as are most Israelis - that there is no Palestinian partner ready to negotiate seriously and implement its promises , the prime minister wants to prepare for an extended interim period .
Assuming that terrorist attacks against Israel are going to continue under any circumstances , he seeks to improve the country &apos;s strategic position to handle this war .
Combined with the long ##AT##-##AT## completed security fence around the Gaza Strip and one being built near Israel &apos;s border with the West Bank , pulling out of the most exposed positions is intended to reduce casualties and the number of clashes with the Palestinians .
A secondary intention is to show the world that Israel is ready to withdraw from most of the remaining territories it captured in 1967 in exchange for real peace .
The United States and Britain have supported the withdrawal plan , while most other European countries have been critical .
While demanding an Israeli withdrawal for years , the Palestinian leadership opposes Sharon &apos;s plan , arguing it is intended to create permanent borders .
Nevertheless , if implemented , Sharon &apos;s proposal would leave them in control of about 99 percent of the Gaza Strip and roughly 50 percent of the West Bank .
If it appears that the withdrawal will proceed and Sharon can assemble a government to implement it , the Palestinian side will then face a major challenge .
Will it be able to put together an effective governmental authority to rule the Gaza Strip , or will that area dissolve into bloody battles among Palestinian factions and a staging area for attacks into Israel that will bring reprisal raids ?
A key issue in this mix is the division of power between the nationalist Fatah group and the Islamist Hamas organization .
Local Fatah officials want support from their leader , Yassir Arafat , to take firm control of the territory .
But Arafat has shown a willingness to let groups act as they please , apparently believing that continuing unrest will bring international sympathy and intervention on his behalf .
Yet Arafat himself will be 75 in a few months and is clearly reaching the end of his career .
He has been the only leader his movement has ever known , having led Fatah for 40 years and the Palestinians as a whole for 35 years .
With no apparent successor , his departure from the scene will bring a massive and unpredictable shake ##AT##-##AT## up in Palestinian politics .
The Israeli government &apos;s projection has been that both the withdrawal and the security fence will be completed by the end of 2005 .
Sharon &apos;s retirement is likely to come within another twelve months , with a new opposition leader having to be chosen as well .
Thus , while the Likud referendum seems to have left the Israeli ##AT##-##AT## Palestinian dispute at yet another impasse , both sides are on the verge of enormous changes .
In many ways , 2005 has been Europe ’ s annus horibilis .
It began well , when Spanish voters approved the draft European Union constitution , but it turned sour when French and Dutch voters spurned it soon after .
Those votes partly reflected displeasure with domestic policies , and partly disappointment with the way governments conduct European affairs .
Governments promptly obliged with more of the same .
Within days of the votes , they failed to agree on the EU budget for 2007 ##AT##-##AT## 13 .
French and British leaders engaged in a heated quarrel that derailed the subsequent summit , before Britain assumed the rotating six ##AT##-##AT## month EU presidency in July .
Normally , countries use their EU presidencies to display their ability to solve problems and move the Union forward .
But , as of early December , Britain has remained dormant .
Besides burying the draft constitution , it has largely sidestepped the budget issue .
Chances that it gets the budget approved this year are slim , and , unless the dispute is resolved soon , the Union will not have an operational budget by 2007 .
Even if a budget is adopted , there is no lack of depressing business for the Austrian presidency , which starts on January 1 .
The deepest problem is Europe ’ s inability to grow at more than a snail ’ s pace and to provide jobs to its citizens .
This is mostly due to the Big Three – France , Germany , and Italy – which produce 70 % of Europe ’ s GDP .
The collective response , adopted in 2000 , has been the “ Lisbon Strategy , ” which aims at making the EU “ the most dynamic and competitive knowledge ##AT##-##AT## based economy in the world ” by 2010 .
More realistically , it is designed to provide governments with the incentive to undertake the reforms that stimulate economic growth and productivity .
That means facing down the myriad interest groups – from industry lobbies to trade unions and entrenched bureaucracies – that have ( so far ) successfully protected their turfs .
The strategy rests on peer pressure , naming and shaming governments that fail to make progress .
In practice , however , peer pressure has become peer collusion .
When EU leaders met last spring to assess progress , they pitifully recognized that the Lisbon Strategy ’ s goal was unlikely to be met .
The best that they could do now would be to dump the pretense of a strategy and carry on with the other business .
Unfortunately , the host of the 2000 summit was José Manuel Barroso , then Prime Minister of Portugal and current President of the European Commission , who has staked his presidency on the Lisbon Strategy .
Expect him to push on hopelessly .
One of the few good ideas contained in the Lisbon Strategy was to remove barriers to trade in services .
Intra ##AT##-##AT## European competition in services is restricted by innumerable national regulations that , for instance , strictly determine the requirements for becoming a hairdresser or a plumber .
One of the defining features of the past decades is the sharp increase in services productivity in the US ; none of that happened in Europe .
Guess why .
Because services account for 70 % of European GDP , the potential impact from enhanced competition is substantial .
But removing protection is always politically difficult .
The European Commission submitted a proposal in 2005 – just as the constitution was being put up for a vote .
Not surprisingly , the proposal was quickly shelved .
Now , with countless private interest groups trying to water it down into irrelevance , the battle will be firmly on the EU ’ s agenda in 2006 .
At the same time , Europe is again blocking progress in the Doha round of world trade talks , with the farmers ’ lobby fighting to preserve its subsidies .
Many governments are so fearful of their farmers that they see no other option than to hold their ground , no matter what .
Europe has agreed to a single trade policy .
When disagreements run as deep as they do on agriculture , there can be no give ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## take of the kind that allows for successful negotiations .
There is little reason for optimism .
And what next for the ECB , which has just nudged up interest rates by 0.25 % , after 30 months on hold .
Experts can disagree about whether the move was premature , but no one agrees with the many political leaders who have argued that the tiny hike will derail the timid resumption of economic growth .
The sharpness of political attacks on the ECB might trigger dangerous talk about restricting its independence .
While such a move is out of the question – it would require a change in the European Treaty – the noise is unhealthy .
It distracts the ECB , adds to the impression that Europe is bad , and , more importantly , will be used by ineffective governments as a scapegoat for their failings .
Expect more ECB ##AT##-##AT## bashing .
Is Europe stuck ?
The current team of leaders has been an enormous disappointment .
But as they fade away , there could be some light at the end of the tunnel .
In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel is obviously more positive on Europe and more pro ##AT##-##AT## reform than her predecessor , but she is tied up in a grand coalition .
In France , President Jacques Chirac , the epitome of a leader captured by his lobbies , is staggering impotently toward the end of his term in 2007 .
The two frontrunners to succeed him , Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy , both in government , compete on a reformist agenda , but pre ##AT##-##AT## election years do not encourage bold moves .
Meanwhile , Italy must decide whether it replaces Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who displayed no interest in reform and European affairs , with the cautious Romano Prodi , the former European Commission President .
Tony Blair , once an ardent pro ##AT##-##AT## European ( at least by Britain ’ s undemanding standards ) , might finally have to cede power to Gordon Brown , who is famously cold to European integration .
Fortunately , Britain has always been an outsider .
In the end , whatever light there is , it may not shine until 2007 , after the French elections .
BERLIN – Afghanistan ’ s future does not look good .
The Taliban are gaining military and political strength , and President Hamid Karzai is losing support at home and internationally due to his administration ’ s rampant corruption and the obvious fraud committed in his re ##AT##-##AT## election .
Weariness with the war is spreading in the United States , where President Barack Obama finds it difficult to decide about an increase in troops , as demanded by his own generals .
European NATO members with troops in Afghanistan would prefer to withdraw them today rather than tomorrow .
The West seems to have lost its orientation in the Hindu Kush – that “ graveyard of empires , ” as it was called after the British disaster in January 1842 , when only one man survived an expedition 16,000 .
What , many people are asking , is NATO really fighting for in Afghanistan ?
Europe remains silent on that question and has only one aim : to get out .
In the US , the debate about the purposes being served in Afghanistan is at least still taking place .
Follow it , and you will conclude that , ultimately , the war is all about the American superpower ’ s military victory over the Taliban , so that it can finally withdraw its troops – for a second time .
The source or meaning of the conflict in Afghanistan is impossible to find in the country itself .
Afghanistan is the battlefield , but the causes of the wars that have devastated it since the mid ##AT##-##AT## 1970 ’ s were and are still to be found beyond its borders .
So an exclusively “ Afghan solution ” is not possible .
Three dates are central to understanding today ’ s Afghan quagmire : 1989 , 2001 , and 2003 .
In 1989 , when the Cold War ended , the Red Army had already withdrawn from the country , thereby admitting its defeat .
Following the Soviet Union , the US withdrew from the conflict , too , and at that moment , the second Afghan war started – a proxy war between regional neighbors over power in the Hindu Kush , disguised as a civil war .
Supported by Saudi Arabia , Pakistan sought strategic depth against its arch ##AT##-##AT## enemy India with the help of militant religious students from Afghan refugee camps . These “ Taliban ” were created and equipped by the Pakistani secret service , the ISI .
Iran defended its own interests and those of the Shia minority in the west of the country .
And in the north , the Tajik Northern Alliance and Abdul Rashid Dostum ’ s Uzbek militia were supported and equipped by Afghanistan ’ s northern neighbors and Russia .
In the shadow of this second Afghan war , Osama bin Laden established his terrorist organization in Taliban ##AT##-##AT## ruled Afghanistan : Al Qaeda , which , on September 11 , 2001 , carried out its terrible terrorist attack on the US .
A month later , the current war in Afghanistan started .
In March 2003 , George W. Bush launched his invasion of Iraq , not only squandering America ’ s military strength , but also connecting all the individual crises between the eastern Mediterranean and the Indus Valley .
As a result of America ’ s foreign ##AT##-##AT## policy folly , Iran became the central geo ##AT##-##AT## political player in the entire region , linking the western and eastern part of this long belt of instability .
So , those who are grappling with the Afghan riddle today should consider , first and foremost , the regional realities : can the West afford to withdraw ?
If so , we should pull out of Afghanistan immediately .
If not , we should stop discussing an “ exit strategy . ”
The cost of the West ’ s retreat from this troubled region is predictable , since we must deal with several threats that endanger Western security , and that would not disappear with withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan : terrorism , Islamist radicalism , nuclear threats ( Pakistan , Iran ) , proxy wars and regional conflicts ( Israel ##AT##-##AT## Palestine , Iraq , Afghanistan , and Kashmir ) , and looming disintegration ( Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and in the longer term in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula ) .
This means that we cannot talk about withdrawing our troops , but only of redrawing the battle line farther West .
It is extremely doubtful that such a step would bring more security .
On the other hand , the West ’ s strategy in Afghanistan up to now has also yielded little progress , only strengthening the Taliban day by day .
So what should we do ?
First , we need to define a clear political goal : a stable status quo in Afghanistan that will prevent the country from again becoming a battlefield of regional interests and an organizational base for Al Qaeda .
Without a sufficient military presence , as well as improved and reinforced reconstruction efforts , this goal is not attainable .
Second , a renewed regional consensus on Afghanistan ’ s future would also help avoid further destabilizing nuclear ##AT##-##AT## armed Pakistan . This requires that Pakistan ’ s and Iran ’ s interests be included in this consensus , as well as India ’ s , Saudi Arabia ’ s and probably also China ’ s .
( The Kashmir conflict must , indirectly , play a role in this settlement , but the difficulties of including it should not be underestimated . )
Forging this consensus will not be an easy diplomatic task .
But it is feasible and should be the goal of a new conference on Afghanistan .
Third , a parallel effort at crisis containment – and perhaps even at finding solutions – is needed for the wider Middle East , Iraq , the Persian Gulf , and Iran .
It ’ s an equation with very many known unknowns , but if we do not try at least to mitigate these issues , the known unknowns will continue challenging all partial solutions .
But the big question remains whether the US and its European allies still have the strength , perseverance and far ##AT##-##AT## sightedness for such an undertaking .
There are good reasons to doubt this .
The alternative would be a chaotic and dangerous future in this large hot spot .
Afghanistan may seem far away , but its chaos and violence are in fact just next door .
The rejection of the European Union ’ s Constitution by French and Dutch voters forces us to think well beyond that treaty .
That much is clear from the current debate on the Community budget .
The naysayers ’ victories show that sovereignty ##AT##-##AT## based arguments that oppose any kind of European political union are on the march .
Euroskeptics , it seems , are gaining ground everywhere , and a kind of xenophobia is on the rise .
But xenophobia and sovereignty were not the primary impulses that propelled the “ no ” votes .
Above all , the “ no ” votes in France and Holland – and rising discontent in other member states , such as Germany – are the result of the inability of national governments and the Union to respond effectively to the problems that most concern citizens .
Not only anti ##AT##-##AT## Europeans rejected the constitution ; far from it .
Many Europeans are , in fact , calling on the EU to act to reduce unemployment and to intervene decisively in the international arena .
Many interpreted Europe ’ s internal division over the war in Iraq , with ordinary citizens overwhelmingly opposed to military intervention , as a sign of the Union ’ s weakness .
But the answer to such doubt and dismay is more Europe , not less . The European Council ’ s summit on June 16 ##AT##-##AT## 17 should give a clear sign that it recognizes this .
Most supporters of the Constitution believe that it will not only help build a citizens ’ Europe , but also create better conditions for European economic development , and for the EU to act globally .
They are right .
It would be imprudent to assume that the French and Dutch “ no ” votes were not about discontent with Union policies ; but that anger was directed against the French and Dutch governments , not Europe itself .
The fact is that citizens in every EU member country are increasingly aware that national policies are determined by decision making at the European level , over which they have little influence .
The European Constitution has little to do with this , but referenda are never confined to the actual questions put to voters .
Instead , they provide opportunities for citizens to express what they feel about the choices their governments make , particularly within the EU framework .
The 2004 elections for the European Parliament had already shown that the level of discontent with the Union was high .
Voters heavily punished almost all national governments .
Yet nobody thought that that election had changed the course of Europe .
Above all , the French and Dutch referendums confirmed that politics in the Union is now conducted “ on the street , ” and that it is no longer possible to “ construct ” Europe at a distance and by stealth .
This means that EU governments must respond to popular anxieties and make the Union more transparent and democratic .
This would be a lot easier with the Constitution in place , but there are measures that can and should be adopted now to make that possible .
First , the community budget should be structured so that it has a significant impact on growth and employment ( a return to the voluntarism of the Delors Packages , now applied to the Lisbon Strategy ) .
Second , European governments must show a real commitment to act together .
A key opportunity presents itself with the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration to define a common position to support democratic change in the Mediterranean by ceasing to back the political status quo there .
Finally , Council meetings should be open when legislative matters are at stake , so that citizens can know who voted for what and according to which criteria .
All of this can be decided at the next European Council , even before the constitutional problem is resolved .
This kind of action is more likely to win back a skeptical citizenry than any information campaign , however well designed .
At the same time , it is necessary to solve the Constitutional deadlock .
As already proposed by the Convention , this would mean separating constitutional matters per se from Union policy .
The real innovations are found in Part I and II of the proposed Constitution , in the definition of the normative and political identity of the Union , its competences , the new institutional balance – including the creation of a European Minister of Foreign Affairs – and , last but not least , the introduction of a Bill of Rights .
The part that was actually rejected and raises the most concerns among citizens of the member States is in Part III , which focuses on Union policies such as the Common Market , competition policy and the Common Agricultural Policy .
So the first and second parts could be ratified without new negotiations and could form the basis for the new Treaty , so that the Treaty of Nice would still apply ; and the debate on the European social model would continue .
It is essential to reaffirm the normative essence of the Constitutional Treaty to protect the greatest achievement of the Constitutional Convention .
Diversity and inclusiveness , through the integration of European democracies with a common project , remains Europe ’ s great gift to the world .
It is what has made Europe an “ international public good ” to use former Brazilian foreign minister Celso Lafer ’ s felicitous turn of phrase .
Such a Europe is better placed to contribute to a fairer international order than the narrow , bitter Europe the xenophobes have in mind .
For Europe to remain a promise for the world , it must thrive as a public good for all its citizens .
Europe and Europeans cannot wait for a new treaty to show that the Union is able to fulfill that promise .
TOKYO – The American economist Herbert Stein once said that if something cannot continue forever , it will not . In the case of imbalances between China and the West , however , the cut ##AT##-##AT## off point still looks to be a long time in the future .
Five years ago , many people warned that excess spending in the West and undervalued exchange rates in Asia were producing unsustainable imbalances .
From 2005 to 2008 , China ’ s bilateral surplus with the United States increased by 41 % , and its trade surplus with Europe more than doubled .
After falling in 2009 , China ’ s surplus with the US and Europe increased by 32 % and 16 % , respectively , in 2010 .
Someone who fell asleep in August 2008 and woke up in 2010 would probably never guess that there had been any interruption whatsoever in China ’ s burgeoning imbalances with the West .
These surpluses are generated primarily within East Asian production networks .
Multinational corporations in Japan , South Korea , and elsewhere ship sophisticated parts and components to China for assembly and re ##AT##-##AT## export to developed countries .
The China Customs Agency classifies this type of trade as “ processing ” trade .
In 2010 , China ran deficits of more than $ 100 billion in processing trade with East Asia and surpluses of $ 100 billion with Europe and $ 150 billion each with the US and Hong Kong .
Its global surplus in processing trade in 2010 totaled $ 322 billion .
While rebalancing is not taking place in processing trade , it is occurring in “ ordinary “ trade ( China ’ s other major customs regime ) .
Ordinary exports are produced using Chinese factors of production , and ordinary imports are intended for China ’ s internal market .
China ’ s balance in ordinary trade shifted from a surplus of $ 38 billion in 2005 to a deficit of $ 48 billion in 2010 .
Researchers at the Centre D ’ Études Prospectives et D ’ Information Internationales , analyzing China ’ s ordinary trade using data up to 2007 ( http : / / www.cepii.fr / anglaisgraph / workpap / summaries / 2011 / wp2011 ##AT##-##AT## 03.htm ) , found that Europe ( especially Germany ) exported large volumes of automobiles and other consumer goods to China .
Moreover , East Asian countries exported increasing quantities of parts and components and capital goods to foreign ##AT##-##AT## owned enterprises in China that produce for the local market .
By contrast , the share of ordinary US exports to China shrank , suggesting that China ’ s rebalancing is likely to be associated with continued large bilateral surpluses with the US .
Subsequent data indicate that this pattern is continuing .
In 2010 , China ’ s ordinary ##AT##-##AT## trade balance recorded a $ 71 billion deficit with East Asia and surpluses of $ 44 billion and $ 23 billion with the US and Europe , respectively .
Europe ’ s ordinary exports to China increased from $ 85 billion in 2009 to $ 115 billion in 2010 .
By contrast , America ’ s ordinary exports to China increased more slowly , from $ 50 billion in 2009 to $ 64 billion in 2010 .
Thus , firms in East Asia and Europe are benefiting more than firms in the US from increasing demand in China .
According to China Customs Statistics , America ’ s combined bilateral deficit in processing and ordinary trade in 2010 totaled $ 186 billion .
But this understates the size of the deficit , because the lion ’ s share of China ’ s processed exports to Hong Kong are trans ##AT##-##AT## shipped to advanced economies ( which means that Europe ’ s bilateral deficit is significantly higher as well ) .
By contrast , US data treat goods coming from China via Hong Kong as being exported from China , yielding a bilateral trade ##AT##-##AT## deficit figure of $ 273 billion , up from $ 203 billion in 2005 .
Many researchers warned in 2005 that imbalances between the US and East Asia were unsustainable , noting that they were driven by excess spending in the US and undervalued exchange rates in East Asia .
Excess spending was fueled by deterioration in the US fiscal balance , from a surplus of 2 % of GDP in 2000 to a deficit of 4 % of GDP in 2004 .
Undervalued exchange rates in Asia were supported by accumulated reserves of almost $ 1 trillion in China , plus hundreds of billions of dollars elsewhere in the region .
Since 2005 , US budget deficits have increased by another 6 % of GDP , while China ’ s external reserves have increased by $ 2 trillion .
It is likely that at some point investors will be unwilling to continue lending to the US at low interest rates , and that China will regard continued reserve accumulation as a bad investment .
At that point , the US trade deficit will shrink .
If imbalances between the US and China are thus unsustainable , it makes sense for policymakers to pursue a soft landing .
In the case of the US , this requires recognizing that the government faces a budget constraint .
For China , it means redirecting saving away from reserve accumulation towards cash ##AT##-##AT## strapped small and medium ##AT##-##AT## size enterprises , as well as much ##AT##-##AT## needed investments in education , health care , and affordable housing .
MOSCOW – The emergence of a Kremlin leader , President Dmitri Medvedev , without a KGB background , combined with the economic crisis , has inspired talk that when Barack Obama visits Moscow , America ’ s president will be seeing a country on the verge of a new political thaw , a revived perestroika .
But pushing the “ re ##AT##-##AT## set button ” on US ##AT##-##AT## Russia relations may be harder than Obama and his team imagined .
Russian ( or Soviet ) leaders opt for perestroika or a thaw only when forced to do so by dire conditions that threaten the regime ’ s survival .
An atmosphere of mortal fear , mutual suspicion , and hatred among the Communist elite was the catalyst for Nikita Khrushchev ’ s post ##AT##-##AT## Stalin thaw .
For Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980 ’ s , the catalyst for his perestroika was the USSR ’ s growing economic paralysis .
For both men , the goal of clinging to power was a top priority .
Changing the system and easing their grip on power was a risky move that could undermine their authority .
But the risks of inertia seemed to be even higher .
In the end , having opted for change , both were forced to leave their posts prematurely , against their will .
As he revived centralized Kremlin control over Russian politics and public affairs , Vladimir Putin has been concerned primarily with minimizing challenges to state power , which he concentrated in his own hands .
To this end , he stripped the political system of competition , emasculated state institutions , marginalized the opposition , and basically eliminated public participation .
His power ##AT##-##AT## building project was facilitated by high oil prices , but came at the cost of a steady deterioration in the quality of governance and abandonment of the goal of modernization .
With policymaking fully nontransparent and reduced to a very closed circle , and implementation delegated to an unaccountable bureaucracy , the inevitable result of Putin ’ s political model was pervasive corruption .
The desire to avoid public discontent and ensure social stability led to a suspension of reform .
Instead of creating incentives that would unleash public energies , the government pushed citizens farther and farther from politics and policymaking , thereby deepening social apathy and atomization .
Moreover , the opportunity provided by the oil boom was wasted .
Indeed , today Russia risks lagging even further behind the developed countries .
Its economy remains undiversified and uncompetitive , and its contribution to global technological progress is minuscule .
Worse still , economic growth based on exports of natural resources has proved unsustainable .
When oil prices were high and growing , the government could compensate for poor performance by throwing money at problems .
Today , with oil prices dramatically reduced , this largesse is no longer available , and economic experts agree that the growth potential of Russia ’ s petro ##AT##-##AT## economy has been exhausted .
Despite all this , the situation is not sufficiently dire to push Russia ’ s leaders to open at least some channels of genuine public participation and yield any of their power .
The price of oil , at around $ 70 a barrel , may be half of what it was a year ago , but up from around $ 40 earlier this year .
Nor does the Russian economy ’ s contraction and the expected deepening of poverty ( the World Bank ’ s report released in late June was grimmer about Russia than its previous report ) presage an immediate catastrophe .
And , unlike in the late 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , Russia is not indebted to foreign banks or international organizations , though it plans to resume foreign borrowing next year .
So the government will prefer to muddle through the crisis , rather than risk any decisive reform .
The goal of clinging to power remains the priority , and risk ##AT##-##AT## aversion the main guideline .
The ruling elite are known to be torn by disputes and rivalries .
Just recently , two of Putin ’ s deputies gave interviews to two Western media outlets offering what sounded like starkly opposite visions for Russia ’ s development .
But such disputes never spill over into the broad public sphere ; members of the elite are primarily concerned about social and political stability and would not stir the public by seeking support for an alternative policy course .
These delaying tactics are enabled by a lack of pressure from below .
Russians may be concerned by growing unemployment and reduced incomes , but this is not manifesting itself in any drive to organize or try to effect political change .
The public below , just like the leaders above , cherish political stability ; the popularity ratings of both Prime Minister Putin and President Dmitri Medvedev remain above 70 % .
Disgruntlement over the increasingly authoritarian governance may be common among business circles , elements of the neutered political opposition , liberal intellectuals , and even part of the bureaucracy .
But these forces are too timid and fragmented , with no drive for political action .
The current government ’ s tactic of muddling through without changing the political system or the structure of the economy is fraught with the risk of gradual decline .
To the Kremlin ’ s rulers , this may seem an acceptable cost for retaining power , but postponing reform will only aggravate Russia ’ s countless problems .
Besides , muddling through may prove unaffordable even in the short run , if oil prices decline again .
A dramatic curtailment of state resources may eventually push the government toward modernization , but it might also produce an uglier shift — toward harder political crackdown , economic nationalism and an essentially isolationist course .
This would be catastrophic for Russia — to say nothing of relations with the US .
CAMBRIDGE – The American economy has recently slowed dramatically , and the probability of another economic downturn increases with each new round of data .
This is a sharp change from the economic situation at the end of last year – and represents a return to the very weak pace of expansion since the recovery began in the summer of 2009 .
Economic growth in the United States during the first three quarters of 2010 was not only slow , but was also dominated by inventory accumulation rather than sales to consumers or other forms of final sales .
The last quarter of 2010 brought a welcome change , with consumer spending rising at a 4 % annual rate , enough to increase total real GDP by 3.1 % from the third quarter to the fourth .
The economy seemed to have escaped its dependence on inventory accumulation .
This favorable performance led private forecasters and government officials to predict continued strong growth in 2011 , with higher production , employment , and incomes leading to further increases in consumer spending and a self ##AT##-##AT## sustaining recovery .
A one ##AT##-##AT## year cut of the payroll tax rate by two percentage points was enacted in order to lock in this favorable outlook .
Unfortunately , the projected recovery in consumer spending didn ’ t occur .
The rise in food and energy prices outpaced the gain in nominal wages , causing real average weekly earnings to decline in January , while the continued fall in home prices reduced wealth for the majority of households .
As a result , real personal consumer expenditures rose at an annual rate of just about 1 % in January , down from the previous quarter ’ s 4 % increase .
That pattern of rising prices and declining real earnings repeated itself in February and March , with a sharp rise in the consumer price index causing real average weekly earnings to decline at an annual rate of more than 5 % .
Not surprisingly , survey measures of consumer sentiment fell sharply and consumer spending remained almost flat from month to month .
The fall in house prices pushed down sales of both new and existing homes .
That , in turn , caused a dramatic decline in the volume of housing starts and housing construction .
That decline is likely to continue , because nearly 30 % of homes with mortgages are worth less than the value of the mortgage .
This creates a strong incentive to default , because mortgages in the US are effectively non ##AT##-##AT## recourse loans : the creditor may take the property if the borrower doesn ’ t pay , but cannot take other assets or a portion of wage income .
As a result , 10 % of mortgages are now in default or foreclosure , creating an overhang of properties that will have to be sold at declining prices .
Businesses have responded negatively to the weakness of household demand , with indices maintained by the Institute of Supply Management falling for both manufacturing and service firms .
Although large firms continue to have very substantial cash on their balance sheets , their cash flow from current operations fell in the first quarter .
The most recent measure of orders for nondefense capital goods signaled a decline in business investment .
The pattern of weakness accelerated in April and May .
The relatively rapid rise in payroll employment that occurred in the first four months of the year came to a halt in May , when only 54,000 new jobs were created , less than one ##AT##-##AT## third of the average for employment growth in the first four months .
As a result , the unemployment rate rose to 9.1 % of the labor force .
The bond market and share prices have responded to all of this bad news in a predictable fashion .
The interest rate on 10 ##AT##-##AT## year government bonds fell to 3 % , and the stock market declined for six weeks in a row , the longest bearish stretch since 2002 , with a cumulative fall in share prices of more than 6 % .
Lower share prices will now have negative effects on consumer spending and business investment .
Monetary and fiscal policies cannot be expected to turn this situation around .
The US Federal Reserve will maintain its policy of keeping the overnight interest rate at near zero ; but , given a fear of asset ##AT##-##AT## price bubbles , it will not reverse its decision to end its policy of buying Treasury bonds – so ##AT##-##AT## called “ quantitative easing ” – at the end of June .
Moreover , fiscal policy will actually be contractionary in the months ahead .
The fiscal ##AT##-##AT## stimulus program enacted in 2009 is coming to an end , with stimulus spending declining from $ 400 billion in 2010 to only $ 137 billion this year .
And negotiations are under way to cut spending more and raise taxes in order to reduce further the fiscal deficits projected for 2011 and later years .
So the near ##AT##-##AT## term outlook for the US economy is weak at best .
Fundamental policy changes will probably have to wait until after the presidential and congressional elections in November 2012 .
SAO PAULO – Brazil , Russia , India , and China recently held their second annual summit in Brasilia .
Journalists continue to lavish attention on these so ##AT##-##AT## called “ BRIC ” countries , but I remain skeptical of the concept .
Goldman Sachs coined the term in 2001 to call attention to profitable opportunities in what it considered “ emerging markets . ”
The BRICs ’ share of world GDP rose from 16 % in 2000 to 22 % in 2008 .
Collectively they did better than average in the subsequent global recession . Together , they account for 42 % of world population and one ##AT##-##AT## third of global economic growth in the past ten years .
Putting aside the United States ( which ranks third in population ) , annual economic growth in the other four most populous countries – China , India , Indonesia , and Brazil – was above 5 ##AT##-##AT## 6 % in 2000 ##AT##-##AT## 2009 .
Obviously , that is good news for the world economy , but an economic term has taken on a political life of its own , despite the fact that Russia fits poorly in the category .
As the Beijing Review commented , “ when Goldman Sachs created the acronym BRIC in 2001 , neither the economists nor the rest of the world imagined that Brazil , Russia , India , and China would finally sit together to build up a substantial platform one day . ” In June 2009 , the foreign ministers of the four countries met for the first time in Yekaterinburg , Russia , to transform a catchy acronym into an international political force .
The BRICs hold $ 2.8 trillion or 42 % of global foreign reserves ( though most of that is Chinese . )
So , in Yekaterinburg , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev declared that “ there can be no successful global currency system if the financial instruments that are used are denominated in only one currency . ” After China eclipsed the US as Brazil ’ s largest trading partner , China and Brazil announced plans to settle trade in their national currencies rather than dollars .
Although Russia accounts for only 5 % of China ’ s trade , the two countries announced a similar agreement .
After the recent financial crisis , Goldman Sachs upped the ante and projected that the combined GDP of the BRICs might exceed that of the G ##AT##-##AT## 7 countries by 2027 , about 10 years sooner than initially believed .
Such simple extrapolations of current economic growth rates often turn out to be mistaken because of unforeseen events .
But , whatever the merits of this linear economic projection , the term BRICs still makes little sense for long ##AT##-##AT## term assessments of global power relations .
While a BRICs meeting may be convenient for coordinating some short ##AT##-##AT## term diplomatic tactics , the term lumps together disparate countries that have deep divisions .
It makes little sense to include Russia , a former superpower , with three developing economies .
Of the four members , Russia has the smallest and most literate population and a much higher per capita income , but , more importantly , many observers believe that Russia is declining while the other three are rising in power resources .
Russia today not only suffers more from the aftermath of the global recession , but it faces severe long ##AT##-##AT## term liabilities : a lack of diversified exports , severe demographic and health problems , and , in Medvedev ’ s own words , an urgent need for “ modernization . ”
As The Financial Times recently pointed out , just two decades ago “ Russia was a scientific superpower , carrying out more research than China , India and Brazil combined .
Since then it has been left behind not only by the world ##AT##-##AT## beating growth of Chinese science but also by India and Brazil . ”
When one looks closely at the numbers , the heart of the BRIC acronym is the rise in China ’ s resources , but the role of Brazil is a pleasant surprise .
When the BRIC acronym was first invented , The Economist objected that “ a country with a growth rate as skimpy as its swimsuits , prey to any financial crisis that was around , a place of chronic political instability , whose infinite capacity to squander its obvious potential was as legendary as its talent for football and carnivals , did not seem to belong with those emerging titans . ”
Now , as The Economist notes , “ in some ways , Brazil outclasses the other BRICs .
Unlike China , it is a democracy .
Unlike India , it has no insurgents , no ethnic and religious conflicts nor hostile neighbors .
Unlike Russia , it exports more than oil and arms and treats foreign investors with respect . ”
Since curbing inflation and instituting market reforms in the 1990 ’ s , Brazil has shown an impressive rate of economic growth in the range of 5 % .
With a territory nearly three times the size of India ’ s , 90 % of its 200 million people literate , a $ 2 trillion GDP equivalent to Russia ’ s and per capita income of $ 10,000 ( three times India ’ s and nearly twice China ’ s ) , Brazil has impressive power resources .
In 2007 , the discovery of massive offshore oil reserves promised to make Brazil a significant power in the energy arena as well .
Brazil , like the other BRICs , also faces a serious number of problems .
It ranks 75th out of 180 countries on Transparency International ’ s corruption perceptions index ( compared to 79th for China , 84th for India , and 146th for Russia ) .
The World Economic Forum ranks Brazil 56th among 133 countries in terms of economic competitiveness ( compared to 29th for China , 49th for India , and 63rd for Russia ) .
Poverty and inequality remain serious problems .
Brazil ’ s Gini coefficient is .57 ( 1.0 is perfect inequality , with one person receiving all income ) , compared to .45 for the United States , .42 for China , .37 for India and .42 for Russia .
So , how seriously should analysts take the term BRIC ?
As an indicator of economic opportunity , they should welcome it , though it would make more sense if Indonesia replaced Russia .
In political terms , China , India , and Russia are competitors for power in Asia , and Brazil and India have been hurt by China ’ s undervalued currency .
Thus , BRIC is not likely to become a serious political organization of like ##AT##-##AT## minded states .
NEW YORK – Twenty years ago , when the Berlin Wall was breached and the Soviet empire was collapsing , only die ##AT##-##AT## hard believers in a communist utopia felt unhappy .
A few people , of course , clung to the possibility of what was once called “ actually existing socialism . ”
Others criticized the triumphalism of the “ new world order ” promised by George H.W. Bush .
And the way West Germany rolled over the wreckage of its East German neighbor seemed almost like an act of cruelty .
Still , 1989 was a good time to be alive ( except in China , where the democrats were put down ) .
Many of us felt that we were seeing the dawn of a new liberal age , in which freedom and justice would spread , like fresh flowers , across the globe .
Twenty years on , we know this was not to be .
Xenophobic populism is stalking democracies in Europe .
Social ##AT##-##AT## democratic parties are shrinking , while right ##AT##-##AT## wing demagogues promise to protect “ Western values ” from the Islamic hordes .
And the economic debacles of the last few years seem to bear out Mikhail Gorbachev ’ s recent warning that “ Western capitalism , too , deprived of its old adversary and imagining itself the undisputed victor and incarnation of global progress , is at risk of leading Western society and the rest of the world down another historical blind alley . ”
The way it looks now , liberals , in the “ progressive ” American sense of the word , may actually have been among the losers of 1989 .
Social democrats were always despised by communists , and vice versa .
But many social ##AT##-##AT## democratic ideals , rooted in Marxist notions of social justice and equality , were thrown out , like the proverbial baby , with the bathwater of communism .
This process was already underway before the fall of the Berlin Wall , with the free ##AT##-##AT## market radicalism of the Thatcher ##AT##-##AT## Reagan era .
Society , Margaret Thatcher once famously declared , doesn ’ t exist .
Only individuals and families counted .
It was everyone for themselves .
For many people , this had the ring of liberation – from overregulated markets , overbearing trade unions , and class privilege . That is why it was called neo ##AT##-##AT## liberalism .
But free ##AT##-##AT## market radicalism undermined the role of the state in building a better , more just , and more equal society .
Neo ##AT##-##AT## liberals are not so much interested in justice as in greater efficiency , more productivity , the bottom line .
At the same time that neo ##AT##-##AT## liberals were slashing and burning their way through old social ##AT##-##AT## democratic arrangements , the left was dissipating its energies on cultural politics , “ identity , ” and ideological multiculturalism .
Democratic idealism was once the domain of the left , including social democrats and liberals .
In the United States , it was Democrats , such as John F. Kennedy , who promoted freedom around the world .
But , in the late twentieth century , it became more important to many leftists to save “ Third World ” culture , no matter how barbaric , from “ neo ##AT##-##AT## colonialism , ” than to support equality and democracy .
People on the left would defend brutal dictators ( Castro , Mao , Pol Pot , Khomeini , et al . ) simply because they opposed “ Western imperialism . ”
As a result , all politics that were derived , no matter how loosely , from Marxism , lost credibility , and finally died in 1989 .
This was naturally a disaster for communists and socialists , but also for social democrats , for they had lost an ideological basis for their idealism .
And , without idealism , politics becomes a form of accounting , a management of purely material interests .
This explains why Italians , and later Thais , chose business tycoons to lead their countries .
They hoped that men who managed to accumulate so much personal wealth could do the same for their voters .
Yet the rhetoric of idealism has not quite disappeared .
It merely shifted from left to right .
This , too , began with Reagan and Thatcher . They took up Kennedy ’ s promotion of democracy in the world .
Once the left abandoned the language of internationalism – democratic revolution , national liberation , and so forth – it was taken up by neo ##AT##-##AT## conservatives .
Their promotion of American military force as the strong arm of democracy may have been misguided , crude , arrogant , ignorant , naïve , and deeply dangerous , but it was indisputably idealistic .
The allure of revolutionary élan has drawn some former leftists to the neo ##AT##-##AT## conservative side .
But most liberals were deeply alarmed by the neo ##AT##-##AT## cons , without being able to find a coherent answer .
Having lost their own zest for internationalism , a common response among liberals to neo ##AT##-##AT## con radicalism has been a call for “ realism , ” non ##AT##-##AT## interference in others ’ affairs , and withdrawal from the world .
This may be the wiser course in many cases , but it is hardly inspiring .
So it is no wonder that a left ##AT##-##AT## wing internationalist , such as French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner , has found a kind of home for his idealism in Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s conservative government .
For the first time since the Kennedy administration , the US is one of the only liberal democracies in the world with a center ##AT##-##AT## left government .
Can President Obama lead the way to a new era of social and political idealism ?
It seems unlikely .
His efforts to provide better healthcare for Americans , for example , is not so much an innovation , as an attempt to catch up with arrangements which most Europeans and Japanese have long taken for granted .
And for this he is already being called a “ socialist ” by his enemies .
Obama is neither a socialist , nor a mere political accountant .
He has some modest ideals , and may yet be an excellent president .
But what is needed to revive liberal idealism is a set of new ideas on how to promote justice , equality and freedom in the world .
Reagan , Thatcher , and Gorbachev , assisted in the end of an ideology , which once offered hope , and inspired real progress , but resulted in slavery and mass murder .
We are still waiting for a new vision , which will lead to progress , but this time , we hope , without tyranny .
BEIJING – The Chinese government ’ s very public display of compassion and transparency in response to the devastating earthquake in Sichuan province appears to have strengthened its authority and its bonds with ordinary Chinese people .
The government and army worked hand in hand with legions of volunteers and private networks to rescue quake victims .
Even die ##AT##-##AT## hard cynics were won over by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao ’ s emotional comforting of the survivors .
But heroic rescue efforts will not be able to help the government forever , so it is worth asking what can provide long ##AT##-##AT## term political legitimacy .
After all , communism has lost its capacity to inspire the Chinese .
So what should replace it ?
Most Westerners think the answer is liberal democracy , as did many Chinese liberals in the twentieth century .
But there is another answer , which takes the form of the old and venerable tradition of Confucianism , which is being revived by government officials , critical intellectuals , and ordinary citizens .
The opening ceremony of the Olympic games will highlight this revival : it will feature not quotes from Marx , but sayings from the Analects of Confucius .
Such sayings as “ The world ’ s peoples are all brothers ” and “ Isn ’ t one of life ’ s greatest pleasures to have friends visiting from afar ? ” will be beamed to billions worldwide , expressing the best that Chinese culture has to offer .
Here , however , we run into trouble .
Ever since the Han dynasty ( more than 2,000 years ago ) , Chinese governments have manipulated the most prominent political interpretations of Confucianism for their own purposes .
Confucianism has been combined with Legalism , China ’ s other main political tradition , to justify such practices as blind obedience to the ruler , subordination of women , and the use of harsh punishments .
The “ official ” Confucianism being revived today may be less dangerous – it emphasizes social harmony , meaning the peaceful resolution of conflicts – but it remains a conservative morality .
But there is another interpretation of Confucianism – let ’ s call it “ left Confucianism ” – that stresses intellectuals ’ obligation to criticize bad policies , obliges governments to provide for the people ’ s material well ##AT##-##AT## being and support those without key family relations , and calls for governments to adopt a more international ##AT##-##AT## minded outlook and to rely on moral power rather than military might to pursue political aims .
It leaves open basic metaphysical commitments and takes a plural and tolerant view of religious life .
It emphasizes equality of opportunity in education as well as meritocracy in government , with leadership positions being distributed to the community ’ s most virtuous and qualified members .
Such values owe their origin to the “ original Confucianism ” of Confucius , Mencius , and Xunzi , which existed before Confucianism became established as state orthodoxy .
In imperial times , the critical tradition was carried forward by such scholars as Huang Zongxi .
Today , new Confucian leftists such as Gan Yang are calling for the creation of a “ Confucian socialist republic . ”
Confucian scholars such as Jiang Qing openly acknowledge that their interpretation of Confucianism most closely parallels socialist ideals : not the “ actually existing socialism ” in today ’ s China , but the socialist ideals defended by Karl Marx and others .
This Confucian tradition aims to influence contemporary politics , but it also remains separate from state power and orthodoxy , always ready to point to the gap between ideals and reality .
Indeed , left Confucianism ’ s departure from the status quo is precisely the point : it is meant to provide a moral standard for social critics and to inspire visions of a more desirable political future .
Unlike communism , it offers a future that derives its legitimacy from tradition and building upon what the past has to offer – including the socialist tradition – rather than destroying it .
Thus , left Confucians favor institutional reform , arguing that the long ##AT##-##AT## term stability and legitimacy of political institutions requires that they be founded on Chinese traditions .
Jiang Qing advocates a tri ##AT##-##AT## cameral legislature – a democratically elected People ’ s House representing the common people ’ s interests , a House of Exemplary Persons to secure the good of all those affected by government policies , including foreigners and minority groups , and a House of Cultural Continuity that would maintain China ’ s various religions and traditions .
Such concrete proposals for political reform inspired by Confucian values can rarely be published in mainland China .
In fact , there are fewer constraints imposed on public discussion of liberal ##AT##-##AT## democratic institutions precisely because few Chinese are inspired by Western ##AT##-##AT## style liberal democracy .
Today , the most viable alternative to China ’ s political status quo is left Confucianism .
The murder of Afghanistan &apos;s Minister of Aviation by a mob ( perhaps incited by members of Afghanistan &apos;s own interim administration ) shows that Afghan society remains deeply fissured .
The first reforms to Afghanistan &apos;s army will only make these divisions worse .
The Minister of Defense in Hamid Karzai &apos;s temporary administration in Kabul has already named the top officers of this new army .
The Minister , General Mohammed Fahim , is a Tajik from the Panjshir district in the North , who rose three months ago to command the Northern Alliance forces that captured Kabul after American bombers cleared the way for them .
As a group , his appointments pose a direct challenge to Mr. Karzai &apos;s goal of reunifying the country .
Afghanistan is a multi ##AT##-##AT## ethnic nation , the largest group being Pashtuns , with two ##AT##-##AT## fifths of the total .
Hazaras and Tajiks constitute about a fifth each of the population .
Of thirty ##AT##-##AT## eight officers elevated to general &apos;s rank by Mr. Fahim , thirty ##AT##-##AT## seven are Tajiks , the other being Uzbek .
If any of the country &apos;s fifteen to seventeen million Pashtuns are recruited as soldiers , they will serve under a command structure made up almost entirely of Tajiks .
The Pashtuns &apos; language , however , is as different from Tajik as Spanish is from English and millions of Pashtuns of military age know only a smattering of Tajik , at best .
The geographical profile of the new military leadership is as narrow as its ethnic makeup .
Thirty ##AT##-##AT## five of the thirty ##AT##-##AT## eight senior officers hail from one small area north of Kabul consisting of Parwan province ( where the Bagram airport is located ) and the nearby Panjshir valley , long the Northern Alliance &apos;s stronghold .
Stated differently , potential leaders from twenty ##AT##-##AT## seven of Afghanistan &apos;s twenty ##AT##-##AT## nine provinces were excluded from their country &apos;s new military elite .
Perhaps so narrow ##AT##-##AT## based a group could overcome the impression that its members are a closed clique if they represented a broad cross ##AT##-##AT## section of the country &apos;s dozen or more political parties .
But this is not the case .
Eighteen of the thirty ##AT##-##AT## eight top brass come from one party , the Jamiat ##AT##-##AT## e-Islami , the Islamic faction that has long been led by mullah and former theology professor Burhanuddin Rabbani .
It was this party that ruled Kabul briefly in the mid ##AT##-##AT## 1990s , creating the bloodshed and chaos that caused most Afghans to welcome the coming of the Taliban .
Almost equaling the number of Jamiat members in the army hierarchy are Communists .
Sixteen of the thirty ##AT##-##AT## eight have long been aligned with this party , whose ploys in the late 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979 ##AT##-##AT## 89 which cost two ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## a-half million Afghan lives .
Most Afghans today view the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that Czechs or Poles reserve for Hitler &apos;s National Socialists .
True , people in Afghanistan , as elsewhere , joined the Communist Party for various reasons , and by no means were all of them hard ##AT##-##AT## core ideologues .
But in the case of General Fahim &apos;s generals , six were professional Communist Party workers , and continued to serve the Party after the Red Army &apos;s invasion .
All six of these men , plus three more Communists who served as officers in the Afghan army , collaborated actively during the Soviet &apos;s decade ##AT##-##AT## long occupation of Afghanistan .
Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of France &apos;s post ##AT##-##AT## World War II officer corps had sided with the Wehrmacht during its occupation of their country .
In Afghanistan news travels quickly by word of mouth .
Afghan nationalists ( which includes nearly all Afghans ) will soon discover the political backgrounds of members of General Fahim &apos;s inner circle , if they don &apos;t know already .
Even this overwhelming evidence of one ##AT##-##AT## sidedness and bias in the formation of the new army &apos;s high command could be neutralized if the generals brought professionalism and commitment to the patriotic values of a truly national armed forces to their work .
Unfortunately , only ten of the thirty ##AT##-##AT## eight brass promoted by Fahim have backgrounds as professional military officers .
An eleventh served as a pilot .
By contrast , twenty ##AT##-##AT## four of the total ( the backgrounds of the remaining four are unknown ) come from civilian life , whether the professions , Communist Party offices , or in one case , a career as a mullah .
What do all these statistics mean in terms of day ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## day reality ?
They mean that when the commanders of the international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan , as well as American military and diplomatic officials , meet Afghanistan &apos;s Deputy Minister of Defense they will encounter Abdul Rashid Dostum , a notoriously brutal and corrupt warlord and Communist who keeps in touch with old Red Army friends still serving in Moscow .
It means that the Chief of the Afghan Armed Forces , as well as the Chief of Operations and the Chief of Army Intelligence are also Communists , men whose loyalties remain uncertain and are distrusted by most Afghans .
Is this a team likely to bring war ##AT##-##AT## torn Afghanistan together ?
Is the presence in Kabul of so dubious a crew likely to instill confidence in the three ##AT##-##AT## quarters of Afghanistan &apos;s population who are shut out of the top army command ?
Or is this list , rather , the harvest of a &quot; winner ##AT##-##AT## take ##AT##-##AT## all &quot; approach to governance that is bound ( at some future point ) to unleash another bloody national backlash by those whose legitimate interests have been cynically trampled ?
UN , European , and American policymakers should ponder these questions before allowing themselves to acquiesce in a ruthless power grab by a small and unpopular minority .
CAMBRIDGE – The tax package agreed to by President Barack Obama and his Republican opponents in the United States Congress represents the right mix of an appropriate short ##AT##-##AT## run fiscal policy and a first step toward longer ##AT##-##AT## term fiscal prudence .
The key feature of the agreement is to continue the existing 2010 income ##AT##-##AT## tax rates for another two years with no commitment about what will happen to tax rates after that .
Without that agreement , tax rates would have reverted in 2011 to the higher level that prevailed before the Bush tax cuts of 2001 .
That would mean higher taxes for all taxpayers , raising tax liabilities in 2011 and 2012 by about $ 450 billion ( 1.5 % of GDP ) .
Because America ’ s GDP has recently been growing at an annual rate of only about 2 % – and final sales at only about 1 % – such a tax increase would probably have pushed the US economy into a new recession .
Although the new tax law is generally described as a fiscal stimulus , it is more accurate to say that it avoids a large immediate fiscal contraction .
The long ##AT##-##AT## term implications of the agreement stand in sharp contrast both to Obama ’ s February 2010 budget proposal and to the Republicans ’ counter ##AT##-##AT## proposal .
Obama wanted to continue the 2010 tax rates permanently for all taxpayers except those with annual incomes over $ 250,000 .
The Republicans proposed continuing the 2010 tax rates permanently for all taxpayers .
By agreeing to limit the current tax rates for just two years , the tax package reduces the projected national debt at the end of the decade ( relative to what it would have been with the Obama budget ) by some $ 2 trillion or nearly 10 % of GDP in 2020 .
That reduction in potential deficits and debt can by itself give a boost to the economy in 2011 by calming fears that an exploding national debt would eventually force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates – perhaps sharply if foreign buyers of US Treasuries suddenly became frightened by the deficit prospects .
The official budget arithmetic will treat the agreement on personal ##AT##-##AT## income tax rates as a $ 450 billion increase in the deficit , making it seem like a big fiscal stimulus .
But the agreement only maintains the existing tax rates , so taxpayers do not see it as a tax cut .
It would be a fiscal stimulus only if taxpayers had previously expected that Congress and the administration would allow the tax rates to rise – an unlikely prospect , given the highly adverse effects that doing so would have had on the currently weak economy .
Even for those taxpayers who had feared a tax increase in 2011 and 2012 , it is not clear how much the lower tax payments will actually boost consumer spending .
The previous temporary tax cuts in 2008 and 2009 appear to have gone largely into saving and debt reduction rather than increased spending .
It is surprising , therefore , that forecasters raised their GDP growth forecasts for 2011 significantly on the basis of the tax agreement .
A typical reaction was to raise the forecast for 2011 from 2.5 % to 3.5 % .
While an increase of this magnitude would be plausible if a forecaster had previously expected tax rates to increase in 2011 , it would not have been reasonable to forecast 2.5 % growth in the first place with that assumption in mind .
So , either the initial 2.5 % forecast was too high or the increase of one percentage point is too large .
What is true of the agreement is also true of the decision , as part of that agreement , to maintain unemployment insurance benefits for the long ##AT##-##AT## term unemployed .
This , too , is essentially just a continuation of the status quo .
No new benefit has been created .
The most substantial potential boost to spending comes from a temporary reduction of the payroll tax , lowering the rate paid by employees on income up to about $ 100,000 from 6.2 % to 4.2 % .
But , while the decline in tax payments will be about 0.8 % of GDP , it is not clear how much of this will translate into additional consumer spending and how much into additional saving .
Because this tax cut will take the form of lower withholding from weekly or monthly wages , it may seem more permanent than it really is , and therefore have a greater impact on spending than households ’ very feeble response to the previous temporary tax changes .
The final component of the agreement is temporary acceleration of tax depreciation , allowing firms in 2011 to write off 100 % of capital investment immediately , in contrast to the current rule , which stipulates a 50 % immediate write ##AT##-##AT## off , followed by depreciation of the remaining 50 % over the statutory life of the equipment .
But , at a time when interest rates are very low and large businesses have enormous amounts of cash on their balance sheets , this change in the timing of tax payments is not likely to do much to stimulate investment .
A greater stimulus to business investment may come from the perception that Obama ’ s agreement to extend the personal ##AT##-##AT## income tax cuts for high ##AT##-##AT## income individuals signals his administration ’ s reduced antagonism to business and the wealthy .
Obama ’ s recent statement that he favors reforming personal and corporate taxes by lowering rates and broadening the tax base reinforces that impression .
Let ’ s hope that ’ s true .
PRINCETON – When I wrote the cover article of the July / August issue of The Atlantic , entitled “ Why Women Still Can ’ t Have It All , ” I expected a hostile reaction from many American career women of my generation and older , and positive reactions from women aged roughly 25 ##AT##-##AT## 35 .
I expected that many men of that younger generation would also have strong reactions , given how many of them are trying to figure out how to be with their children , support their wives ’ careers , and pursue their own plans .
I also expected to hear from business representatives about whether my proposed solutions – greater workplace flexibility , ending the culture of face ##AT##-##AT## time and “ time machismo , ” and allowing parents who have been out of the workforce or working part ##AT##-##AT## time to compete equally for top jobs once they re ##AT##-##AT## enter – were feasible or utopian .
What I did not expect was the speed and scale of the reaction – almost a million readers within a week and far too many written responses and TV , radio , and blog debates for me to follow – and its global scope .
I have conducted interviews with journalists in Britain , Germany , Norway , India , Australia , Japan , the Netherlands , and Brazil ; and articles about the piece have been published in France , Ireland , Italy , Bolivia , Jamaica , Vietnam , Israel , Lebanon , Canada , and many other countries .
Reactions differ across countries , of course .
Indeed , in many ways , the article is a litmus test of where individual countries are in their own evolution toward full equality for men and women .
India and Britain , for example , have had strong women prime ministers in Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher , but now must grapple with the “ woman ##AT##-##AT## as ##AT##-##AT## man ” archetype of female success .
The Scandinavian countries know that women around the world look to them as pioneers of social and economic policies that enable women to be mothers and successful career professionals , and that encourage and expect men to play an equal parenting role .
But they are not producing as many women managers in the private sector as the United States is , much less at the top ranks .
The Germans are deeply conflicted .
One major German magazine decided to frame my contribution to the debate as “ career woman admits that it ’ s better to be home . ”
Another ( more accurately ) highlighted my emphasis on the need for deep social and economic change to allow women to have equal choices .
The French remain studiously aloof , even a little disdainful , as befits a nation that rejects “ feminism ” as an anti ##AT##-##AT## feminine American creation and manages to produce a leader who is simultaneously as accomplished and as elegant as Christine Lagarde , the head of the International Monetary Fund .
Of course , the example of her predecessor , Dominique Strauss ##AT##-##AT## Kahn , and other stories about French male behavior that would count as clear sexual harassment in the stodgy US , suggest that perhaps a bit more feminisme a la Française is in order .
Beyond Europe , Japanese women lament how far they must still go in a relentlessly male and sexist culture .
The Chinese now have a generation of educated , empowered young women who are not sure whether they want to marry at all , owing to the constraints that a husband ( and a mother ##AT##-##AT## in ##AT##-##AT## law ) would place on their freedom .
Brazilian women point with pride to their president , Dilma Rousseff , but also underscore how much discrimination remains .
In Australia , with its robust work ##AT##-##AT## life debate , women point to the success of Julia Gillard , the first woman prime minister , but note that she has no children ( nor does German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the first woman to lead her country ) .
The global nature of this debate demonstrates at least three important lessons .
First , if “ soft power ” means exercising influence because “ others want what you want , ” as Joseph Nye puts it , then women the world over want what American feminists began fighting for three generations ago .
Second , Americans , not surprisingly , have much to learn from other countries ’ debates , laws , and cultural norms .
After all , women have ascended the political ladder faster in many other countries than they have in the US .
Indeed , the US has never had a woman president , Senate majority leader , Secretary of the Treasury , or Secretary of Defense .
Finally , these are not “ women ’ s issues , ” but social and economic issues .
Societies that discover how to use the education and talent of half their populations , while allowing women and their partners to invest in their families , will have a competitive edge in the global knowledge / innovation economy .
Of course , hundreds of millions of women around the world can only wish that they had the problems about which I wrote .
Last week brought news of yet another murder of a women ’ s rights activist in Pakistan ; evidence that the Egyptian military may be deliberately using sexual assault to deter women from demonstrating in Cairo ’ s Tahrir Square ; a horrific report from the New York ##AT##-##AT## based Women ’ s Media Center about Syrian government forces ’ use of sexual violence and gang rape ; and a video of a Taliban commander brutally executing a woman for adultery as his fellow soldiers and villagers cheered .
Those are just the most extreme cases of physical violence that many women face .
Worldwide , more than a billion women confront grinding and overt gender discrimination in education , nutrition , health care , and salaries .
Women ’ s rights are a global issue of the highest importance , and it is necessary to focus on the worst violations .
Still , consider a recent matter ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## fact report from a sober and respected US magazine .
In an article on “ Women in Washington , ” the National Journal observed that women in the US capital have come a long way , but “ still face career barriers , and often the biggest one is having a family . ”
If “ having a family ” is still a career barrier for women , but not for men , that , too , is a matter of women ’ s rights ( and thus of human rights ) .
In the global debate about work , family , and the promise of gender equality , no society is exempt .
NEW YORK – At the outset of the ongoing violent protests in South Korea over imported beef from the United States , the entire cabinet of South Korean President Lee Myung ##AT##-##AT## bak offered to resign . Last week , President Lee fired three of them .
But beef , it turns out , represents just the tip of the iceberg of grievances against President Lee .
Only four months in office , his approval rating is down to single digits .
Lee won the December 2007 election with 48.7 % of the vote , having run on the “ 747 ” platform , promising 7 % annual GDP growth , per capita income of $ 40,000 , and to make Korea the world ’ s seventh largest economy ( up from 13th currently ) .
During his inauguration speech , he vowed to revive the economy , strengthen relations with the US , and deal with North Korea .
So what went wrong ?
The economy is slowing – the Bank of Korea cut its growth forecast for this year to 4.7 % , while the OECD expects only 4.3 % growth – inflation is rising , and some are concerned that Lee ’ s policies are too geared toward foreign investors and big business .
Lee also must confront factors beyond his control , such as soaring oil prices and the global credit crunch .
Beyond the economy , Lee has been faced with charges of appointing officials with questionable ethics and of heavy ##AT##-##AT## handed leadership ( his nickname is “ Bulldozer ” ) , which is reflected in efforts to push through a controversial cross ##AT##-##AT## country canal system and an unpopular proposal to privatize the healthcare system .
Furthermore , Lee ’ s hard ##AT##-##AT## line approach to North Korea – very different from that of his predecessors – has resulted in a popular backlash .
To be sure , as North Korea seemingly snubbed the international community in recent years , there was considerable popular discontent with the previous two administrations ’ “ sunshine ” policy , which emphasized peaceful cooperation prior to eventual Korean unification .
But now , with the North ’ s destruction of key elements of its nuclear program , international negotiations appear to be bearing fruit , and Lee ’ s tougher stance has gained less approval than might have been anticipated when he came to office .
The combined effect of these developments has been to erode Lee ’ s reputation precipitously .
Now , on top of everything , comes the beef controversy .
In April , on his first foreign trip following his inauguration , Lee traveled to the US .
On the eve of the visit , his government agreed to lift the five ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old ban on US beef imports as part of efforts to improve bilateral ties following years of up ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## down relations during former President Roh Moo ##AT##-##AT## hyun ’ s administration .
While most in the West applauded Lee ’ s visit , the reaction in Korea was significantly more negative .
Many in Korea viewed the beef decision as having been hastily taken , and without appropriate consultation of all relevant parties .
In addition , significant segments of the population saw the agreement as Lee selling out or kowtowing to the Americans .
The public reaction began with a demonstration in Seoul on May 2 in which hundreds of teenagers held a candlelight vigil .
Soon , tens of thousands of Koreans joined the protests .
Lee seems to have misjudged the strength of his election victory and the currents of opinion in several important ways .
Given the nationalist sentiments motivating the beef protesters , the strength of opposition forces , and widespread hostility to opening and privatizing the South Korean economy further , Lee , whose authoritarian style of management reminds many of the era of military rule , will now need to move forward carefully .
Lee must reach out to the opposition , both within his party and outside it , to build agreement or negotiate compromise on the contentious issues that his administration faces .
He must reach out to the people of Korea and demonstrate that he is willing to listen to their concerns and act accordingly .
Finally , he must act on his campaign promises to build a more prosperous and confident Korea .
The upside of all this political turmoil is that it demonstrates the vigor of Korean democracy .
Lee ’ s task now is to discover how best to take advantage of this new political activism .
He has faced political adversity before , and he will again .
And , with approval ratings in the single digits , there ’ s nowhere to go but up .
BRUSSELS – Several years ago , as terrorism , immigration , and unrest in suburban Paris were at the top of the news in France , a French police officer confided to a researcher : “ If you consider different levels of trafficking , it is obviously done by blacks and Arabs .
If you are on the road and see a black man or a man with Arabic features , you say to yourself , ‘ He doesn ’ t look French , ’ and then you might stop him to see if he has papers . ”
This police officer was describing a textbook example of “ ethnic profiling ” : law enforcement officials use of stereotypes , rather than specific information about behavior , in deciding to stop , search , or detain people .
Ethnic profiling is illegal in Europe .
It is ineffective in apprehending criminals .
It is counter ##AT##-##AT## productive in the campaign against terrorism .
But police officers across Europe continue to use it .
The inefficiency of ethnic profiling was highlighted in early May , when the British government released figures showing that , of the more than 117,000 police stops made between 2007 and 2008 , only 72 led to an arrest for terrorism ##AT##-##AT## related offences .
Other major European countries do not collect data on police stops broken down according to the targets ’ ethnic or religious background .
But private research and anecdotal reports provide a frighteningly similar picture .
A massive data ##AT##-##AT## mining exercise in Germany from 2001 to 2003 trawled through personal information on 8.3 million people and failed to find a single terrorist .
Stops and searches conducted under counter ##AT##-##AT## terrorism powers in Europe have produced few terrorism charges and no convictions .
Separate studies in Britain , the Netherlands , Sweden , and the United States have concluded that ethnic profiling wastes time and resources .
As a new report by the Open Society Justice Initiative shows , by targeting ethnic minorities , police alienate some of the very people on whom they depend for cooperation and intelligence .
And by pre ##AT##-##AT## selecting fixed categories of people for heightened scrutiny , the authorities overlook those who do not fit the profile .
A young Spanish man who is a member of an ethnic minority group put it this way : “ I worry when I go on the street that the police will stop me and ask me for my papers because of the color of my skin , by my tone of skin , by my way of walking . ”
Given its failings , why is ethnic profiling so widespread ?
The answer is simple .
When the police use ethnic profiling , they project an image of being tough on crime and terrorism .
This appeases public opinion , which demands robust anti ##AT##-##AT## terrorism action .
Following the September 2001 attacks in New York , and again after the bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005 , law ##AT##-##AT## enforcement authorities across Europe launched mass ##AT##-##AT## arrest operations , undertook widespread surveillance of mosques , carried out stops and searches of people who appeared to be Muslim , and used other intrusive measures that disrupted the lives of – and in many cases humiliated – law ##AT##-##AT## abiding European citizens .
As public anxiety has abated , and senior officials have felt less pressure to show that they are doing something , the most flagrant abuses have declined .
But such practices are still being applied to a lesser degree , and they can be pulled out of the arsenal whenever political or social conditions dictate .
Fortunately , some of Europe ’ s leaders recognize the problem .
In late April , the European Parliament issued a report highlighting the danger that unrestricted data mining that relies on racial , ethnic , or national origin would subject innocent people to arbitrary stops , travel restrictions , and bans on employment or banking .
The report called for legislation to protect against ethnic profiling .
The solution is not to ignore the threat of terrorism , but to address the threat more intelligently .
Over the past two years , a project that our organization undertook with police forces and civil ##AT##-##AT## society groups in Hungary and Spain found that , when stops were systematically monitored and data publicly reported , the proportion of stops that produced an arrest or other law ##AT##-##AT## enforcement outcome actually increased .
Police work became more efficient .
This makes sense .
When officers are required to articulate grounds for suspicion , they are more likely to rely on behavioral factors rather than prejudice .
In the future , the European Union and its member states should fund more collaboration between police and minority communities .
The EU should combat radicalization by addressing exclusion , not by conflating conservative religious faith with terrorism .
And it should make clear that police may not use ethnic , racial , or religious stereotypes .
By treating people as suspicious purely because of who they are , how they look , or where they pray , rather than what they do or have done , ethnic profiling threatens the very ethos of the EU , a union firmly rooted in values of liberty , democracy , and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
WARSAW : Everywhere in Europe , traditional right wing parties are in crisis .
Britain &apos;s Tories appear on a suicidal march to isolating themselves in an imaginary little England .
A civil war grips the French right , with a Euro MP grandson of Charles de Gaulle abandoning the Gaullists to join Jean ##AT##-##AT## Marie Le Pen &apos;s National Front .
Even Germany &apos;s rock solid Christian Democrats are poised over an abyss of scandal .
Only the extreme right ##AT##-##AT## wing Freedom Party of Austria &apos;s Jörg Haider is on the march .
Is Europe &apos;s right doomed to extinction or extremism ?
I am neither a man of the left , nor of the right .
Still , the troubles of the right should worry all thinking democrats ; and these troubles are not confined to Europe &apos;s western half .
Two years ago I admired the professionalism with which Poland &apos;s and Hungary &apos;s rightist parties came to power .
Since then , like Western Europe &apos;s conservatives , they managed to – at least in political terms – botch nearly everything .
Both movements now garner only around 20 % of support in opinion polls .
So ##AT##-##AT## called post ##AT##-##AT## communists are flying high with around 70 % .
Perhaps the collapsing popularity of the right in our new democracies tells something about the right in Europe &apos;s old democracies .
For like their Western counterparts , the Polish and Hungarian conservatives are caught between their increasingly unappealing neo ##AT##-##AT## liberalism and their increasingly anachronistic communitarian traditions .
Fidesz in Hungary and the Solidarity Electoral Alliance ( AWS ) in Poland gained power two years ago because of a reaction to their post ##AT##-##AT## communist predecessors .
During their tenures , neither post ##AT##-##AT## communist party rocked the reform boat very much , nor did they threaten democracy .
Yet the voters were ready to move away from the old ties – the electorate had become much younger in the 1990s and the improvements over the old regime , after the recession of the early 1990s had run its course and the reform policies began to pay off , became palpable .
In fact , people may have been somewhat ashamed at having allowed the post ##AT##-##AT## communists to win the second round of democratic elections in mid ##AT##-##AT## 1990s .
The right always saw the post ##AT##-##AT## communist interlude as a type of locust years – a time when the seeds of reform withered .
So the rightist rhetoric hardened .
No longer was it neo ##AT##-##AT## liberal .
What we heard was a robust form of Christian conservatism unheard since the days of de Gaulle , Adenauer , and de Gasperi – and the communitarian tone helped sweep the post ##AT##-##AT## communists away .
The right in Poland and Hungary used the communitarian rhetoric of Christian conservatism , but once in power , they reverted to their original programs and governed like neo ##AT##-##AT## liberals .
The outcome was positive economically but a disaster politically .
For people ask : if growth is strong , why is unemployment high ?
Why are state schools and health services so bad ?
Why do we suddenly have an underclass of the kind we used to see in the American cities portrayed in communist propaganda films ?
As the rigors of the transition continued , fatigue set it .
And that fatigue with liberal economics found resonance in our memories .
We remember something called &quot; Solidarity , &quot; which promised that we were equal brethren ; that everyone would be taken care of .
The common good , civil society : all were to be nourished in our post ##AT##-##AT## communist democracies .
Although few seriously question the free market economy and liberal individualism in manners and customs , we feel uneasy about forsaking these values .
Two years ago our new right governments promised to tame the coldness of the market with the warmth of human understanding .
But in keeping to the reform path they failed to discover a language which reconciled their policies with these goals .
Their warmth seemed nothing but political hot air .
The so ##AT##-##AT## called left , both in Poland and in Hungary , has a language which ( coming from ex ##AT##-##AT## communists ) is breathtakingly cynical , yet effective .
It is a carbon copy of the language of the social ##AT##-##AT## democrats who are so successful in Western Europe .
Because our right ##AT##-##AT## leaning governments have been too decent to use the populist language of the radical right , they are helpless in appealing to mass emotions .
Their words appear to have nothing to do with their deeds .
They talk of family , morality , nation , but their policies lead to NATO , the European Union , massive foreign investment , international capital , and globalization – all things that appear to undermine the communitarian values of the right .
Here our right confronts much the same dilemma as that facing the right in Western Europe – how to bridge the gulf between the market and the community .
Unlike in the English ##AT##-##AT## speaking world , liberalism has never been really popular on the European continent , and the conservatives have always appealed to the patriotic and religious feelings of their supporters .
The traditional right is therefore caught between a populist line that still appeals to the voters and the liberalizing policies that are the stuff of modern government everywhere .
The choice that the Austrian conservatives now face appears to confirm this stark dichotomy .
In this light , Haider may not be a historical leftover somehow unearthed in the mountains and valleys of Carinthia , but an augury of the future of the right across the European continent .
There was much talk recently about the &quot; crisis of the left , &quot; as the Labor party in Britain , the Social ##AT##-##AT## Democrats in Germany , and the Democrats in America had to struggle between their old socialist and New Deal traditions and the imperatives of a modern economy , with the fading labor unions and other political bastions of the old left .
The left may have not found any real answers to its predicaments , but through a pragmatic patchwork of policies and rhetoric it managed to reclaim the center stage .
All the while , the seemingly unstoppable march of the market , globalization , and individualism that had propelled the right since Thatcher and Reagan came to an abrupt halt .
And the communitarian traditions of the right , with their nationalist past lurking behind , may not be any easier to revitalize than the old fashioned socialism or New Deal populism .
CAMBRIDGE – This year ’ s presidential campaign in the United States has been marked by calls from Barack Obama ’ s would ##AT##-##AT## be Republican challengers for a radical transformation of American foreign policy .
Campaigns are always more extreme than the eventual reality , but countries should be wary of calls for transformational change .
Things do not always work out as intended .
Foreign policy played almost no role in the 2000 US presidential election .
In 2001 , George W. Bush started his first term with little interest in foreign policy , but adopted transformational objectives after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Like Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt , and Harry Truman before him , Bush turned to the rhetoric of democracy to rally his followers in a time of crisis .
Bill Clinton had also talked about enlarging the role of human rights and democracy in US foreign policy , but most Americans in the 1990 ’ s sought normality and a post ##AT##-##AT## Cold War peace dividend rather than change .
By contrast , Bush ’ s 2002 National Security Strategy , which came to be called the Bush Doctrine , proclaimed that the US would “ identify and eliminate terrorists wherever they are , together with the regimes that sustain them . ”
The solution to the terrorist problem was to spread democracy everywhere .
Bush invaded Iraq ostensibly to remove Saddam Hussein ’ s capacity to use weapons of mass destruction and , in the process , to change the regime .
Bush cannot be blamed for the intelligence failures that attributed such weapons to Saddam , given that many other countries shared such estimates .
But inadequate understanding of the Iraqi and regional context , together with poor planning and management , undercut Bush ’ s transformational objectives .
Although some of Bush ’ s defenders try to credit him with the “ Arab Spring ” revolutions , the primary Arab participants reject such arguments .
Bush was described by The Economist as “ obsessed by the idea of being a transformational president ; not just a status ##AT##-##AT## quo operator like Bill Clinton . ”
Then ##AT##-##AT## Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised the virtues of “ transformational diplomacy . ”
But , while leadership theorists and editorial writers tend to think that transformational foreign ##AT##-##AT## policy officials are better in either ethics or effectiveness , the evidence does not support this view .
Other leadership skills are more important than the usual distinction between transformational and “ transactional ” leaders .
Consider President George H.W. Bush , who did not do “ the vision thing , ” but whose sound management and execution underpinned one of the most successful US foreign ##AT##-##AT## policy agendas of the past half ##AT##-##AT## century .
Perhaps genetic engineers will one day be able to produce leaders equally endowed with both vision and management skills ; comparing the two Bushes ( who shared half their genes ) , it is clear that nature has not yet solved the problem .
This is not an argument against transformational leaders .
Mohandas Gandhi , Nelson Mandela , and Martin Luther King , Jr . , played crucial roles in transforming people ’ s identity and aspirations .
Nor is this an argument against transformational leaders in US foreign policy .
Franklin Roosevelt and Truman made crucial contributions .
But , in judging leaders , we need to pay attention to acts of both omission and commission , to what happened and to what was avoided , to the dogs that barked and to those that did not .
A big problem in foreign policy is the complexity of the context .
We live in a world of diverse cultures , and we know very little about social engineering and how to “ build nations . ”
When we cannot be sure how to improve the world , prudence becomes an important virtue , and grandiose visions can pose grave dangers .
In foreign policy , as in medicine , it is important to remember the Hippocratic Oath : first , do no harm .
For these reasons , the virtues of transactional leaders with good contextual intelligence are very important .
Someone like George H. W. Bush , unable to articulate a vision but able to steer successfully through crises , turns out to be a better leader than someone like his son , possessed of a powerful vision but with little contextual intelligence or management skill .
Former Secretary of State George Shultz , who served under Ronald Reagan , once compared his role to gardening – “ the constant nurturing of a complex array of actors , interests , and goals . ”
But Shultz ’ s Stanford colleague , Condoleezza Rice , wanted a more transformational diplomacy that did not accept the world as it was , but tried to change it .
As one observer put it , “ Rice ’ s ambition is not just to be a gardener – she wants to be a landscape architect . ” There is a role for both , depending on the context , but we should avoid the common mistake of automatically thinking that the transformational landscape architect is a better leader than the careful gardener .
We should keep this in mind as we assess the current US presidential debates , with their constant reference to American decline .
Decline is a misleading metaphor .
America is not in absolute decline , and , in relative terms , there is a reasonable probability that it will remain more powerful than any other country in the coming decades .
We do not live in a “ post ##AT##-##AT## American world , ” but we also do not live in the American era of the late twentieth century .
The US will be faced with a rise in the power resources of many others – both states and non ##AT##-##AT## state actors .
It will also confront a growing number of issues that require power with others as much as power over others in order to obtain the country ’ s preferred outcomes .
America ’ s capacity to maintain alliances and create cooperative networks will be an important dimension of its hard and soft power .
The problem of America ’ s role in the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century is not one of ( poorly specified ) “ decline , ” but rather of developing the contextual intelligence to understand that even the largest country cannot achieve what it wants without others ’ help .
Educating the public to understand this complex globalized information age , and what is required to operate successfully in it , will be the real transformational leadership task .
Thus far , we are not hearing much about it from the Republican candidates .
On December 16 , Orhan Pamuk , one of Turkey ’ s most famous writers , will enter an Istanbul court to face a charge of “ insulting the national identity ” after he advocated open discussion of the Turkish genocide of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916 .
Pamuk faces three years in prison .
Turkey ’ s effort to fine and imprison those who do not toe the official line convinces me that I was correct to oppose opening negotiations on the country ’ s European Union membership .
In December 1999 , the European Council granted Turkey the status of EU candidate ##AT##-##AT## member , implying that Turkey would accede to the Union at some future , unspecified date .
The Council subsequently asked the European Commission to decide by October 2004 whether Turkey had sufficiently fulfilled the political criteria – including democracy , the rule of law , and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities – for membership .
That decision was one of the last taken by Romano Prodi ’ s Commission , of which I was a member .
Of its 30 members , 29 said that Turkey had fulfilled the criteria sufficiently to proceed .
I was the lone dissenter .
The Commission ’ s own report on Turkey , prepared by Günter Verheugen , who was then in charge of EU enlargement , shaped my decision .
This report mentioned that in 2003 some 21,870 Turks submitted asylum claims in the EU , of which 2,127 were accepted .
In other words , the EU ’ s own governments acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted more than 2,000 of its own citizens .
Meanwhile , the Commission published a progress report on Turkey that granted that reforms were continuing , albeit at a slower pace , under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’ s mildly Islamic ##AT##-##AT## minded government .
Yet the report also presented serious misgivings : human rights violations , including torture , continued ; the military ’ s influence remained too high ; freedom of speech was not universally observed ; non ##AT##-##AT## Muslim religious and cultural minorities faced discrimination ; and violence against women was not opposed strongly enough .
Not much has changed since accession talks began this October .
Beyond the current persecution of Pamuk , unacceptable behavior abounds .
In March 2005 , the police violently disrupted a demonstration to celebrate International Women ’ s Day .
In May , the largest teachers ’ union was banned for promoting the education of Turkey ’ s 14 million Kurds in their own language .
Indeed , intolerance goes right to the top of the Turkish government .
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül abruptly cancelled a recent press conference in Copenhagen when he spied a Kurdish journalist in the audience and the Danes refused to evict him .
Such actions and attitudes amply justify my dissent of October 2004 .
But , even if these shortcomings were removed , Turkey should still not be admitted to the EU , because it is not a European country .
Christianity , feudalism , the Renaissance , the Enlightenment , democracy , and industrialization have made us what we Europeans are , but they have not made Turks who they are .
So I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey implemented at the insistence of the European Commission would continue after accession .
Indeed , I suspect that there will be backsliding .
Moreover , Turkey ’ s accession would lead inevitably to that of Ukraine , Belarus , and Moldova , and perhaps of Georgia , Armenia , and Azerbaïdjan .
The first three of these countries are certainly more European than Turkey .
Leaving the three Caucasian republics aside but including the successor states to Yugoslavia , this would mean an EU of some 35 members .
What sort of Union would that be ?
The EU is not simply a club of friends .
It is based on freedom of movement of goods , services , capital , and people .
The Commission , as the guardian of the Union ’ s treaties , must protect these four fundamental freedoms , which means that it must sometimes persuade , and if necessary force , member states to change their laws .
Alcohol policy in Sweden , the Volkswagen ##AT##-##AT## law in Germany , and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are examples of cases that made the Commission unpopular .
But they were necessary .
By the time I left the Commission , I was sitting on a pile of 1,500 such infringement proceedings .
In short , EU membership entails having to accept incisive measures that deeply affect a state ’ s internal affairs .
That will be impossible with such disparate members .
The EU would fall victim to what the historian Paul Kennedy calls “ imperial overreach . ”
The EU would become unacceptably diluted .
That is why former French President Valéry Giscard d ’ Estaing feared that Turkey ’ s entry would lead to the EU ’ s breakup , and it is why former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said , “ Accession of Turkey would be more than the EU could bear . ”
But the strongest reason to oppose Turkey ’ s accession is a question of democracy : a majority of the EU ’ s population simply does not want it .
NEW YORK – For those of us who have long claimed that the world ’ s international financial architecture needed deep reform , the call for a “ Bretton Woods II ” is welcome .
Of course , similar calls were made after the Asian and Russian crises of 1997 ##AT##-##AT## 1998 , but were not taken seriously by the rich industrial countries .
Now that these countries are at the center of the storm , perhaps they will now be serious .
Two fundamental problems exist with the call for reform .
First , it lacks content : it is unclear what any eventual Bretton Woods II discussions will be about .
Second , the process started the wrong way , by excluding most countries from the talks .
It is obviously good for the G ##AT##-##AT## 7 or a subset of G ##AT##-##AT## 7 members to show leadership , but no fundamental reform can occur without an inclusive process that gives both industrial and developing countries , and both large and small countries an adequate voice .
Global institutions , not ad hoc groups of countries , must be at the center of the reform effort .
The clearest issue right now is correcting the deficit of regulations that characterizes global financial markets .
Discussion must start by agreeing on regulatory principles .
An obvious one is that regulations must be comprehensive , to avoid the massive loopholes that led to the current turmoil .
Regulations should also have a strong counter ##AT##-##AT## cyclical focus , preventing excessive accumulation of leverage and increasing capital and provisions ( reserves ) during booms , as well as preventing asset price bubbles from feeding into credit expansion .
Reliance on financial institutions ’ internal models , the major focus of the Basel II agreement on banking regulation , should be discarded .
That strategy has now been exposed as perilous , and the use by financial institutions of similar risk models can lead to greater instability .
Any new regulatory system should be based on a well functioning network of national and regional authorities ( still missing in the European Union ) and include truly international supervision of financial institutions with a global reach .
Most agree that the International Monetary Fund should not be at the center of the regulatory system .
The Bank for International Settlements and the Basel Committee are better placed , but a fundamental reform is needed to broaden their membership and to avoid a major problem of the Basel Committee : its lack of representation of developing countries .
Three central issues of IMF reform should also be taken on board .
The first is the need for a truly global reserve currency , perhaps based on the IMF Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) .
This would overcome both the inequities and the instability that is inherent in a global reserve system based on a national currency .
Today ’ s system is plagued by cycles of confidence in the dollar and by periodic shocks due to American policies that are adopted independently of their global impact and thus imposed on the rest of the world .
The second issue is the need to place the IMF , not the G ##AT##-##AT## 7 – or any other “ G ” – at the center of global macroeconomic policy coordination .
This is the only way to give developing countries a voice .
The multilateral surveillance on global imbalances that the Fund launched in 2006 was an interesting step in this direction , but it has lacked commitment by the parties , as well as teeth .
The third issue is developing countries ’ major demand . The IMF should lend during balance ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## payments crises rapidly and without overburdening conditions , particularly when the source of the crisis is a rapid reversal of capital flows or a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade . This would make the IMF more like a central bank , providing liquidity in an agile way , just as advanced countries ’ central banks have been providing funds on a massive scale recently .
In the case of the IMF , the financing for such liquidity could be counter ##AT##-##AT## cyclical issues of SDRs .
In all these areas , the IMF should make more active use of regional institutions .
For a decade , I have proposed that the IMF of the future should be seen as the apex of a network of regional reserve funds – that is , a system closer in design to the European Central Bank or the United States Federal Reserve system .
A similar institutional design could be adopted for prudential policies .
A denser network of institutions seems better adapted to a heterogeneous international community , and it is likely to provide better services and give a stronger voice to smaller countries .
Finally , one major deficiency of the current international financial architecture is the lack of an institutional framework – i.e. , a court similar to those created to manage bankruptcies in national economies – to manage debt overhangs at the international level .
The current system relies on ad hoc mechanisms , which generally operate too late , after high indebtedness has already imposed devastating effects .
The only regular institutional mechanism is the Paris Club , which deals exclusively with official financing . Bretton Woods II should resolve this problem by creating an international debt court .
The current financial crisis has made the need for reform of the international financial architecture patently clear .
But any summons to a “ Bretton Woods II ” conference must be concrete in its content .
A global system for prudential regulation and supervision ; a revamped IMF managing a global reserve currency , coordinating global macroeconomic policy , and providing agile credit lines ; and an international debt court – all of these must be on the agenda .
BRUSSELS – The eurozone is being thrown into turmoil by a collective rush to the exits by investors .
Yields on government debt of peripheral eurozone countries are skyrocketing , because investors do not really know what the risks are .
Officials want to be reassuring .
Investors should not worry , they argue , because the current bailout mechanism – the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) – has worked so far without any haircut for bondholders , and will continue to be applied until about 2013 .
Only after that date would any new mechanism open the door for losses for private investors , and only for debt issued after that date .
But markets do not trust this message – and for good reason : it is not credible , because it makes no economic sense .
After all , the claim that the risk of loss will arise only for debt issued after the new crisis ##AT##-##AT## resolution mechanism starts in 2014 implies that all debt issued until then is safe , and that insolvency can occur only in some distant future , rather than now , as in Greece and Ireland . In effect , EU officials are saying to investors , “ Whom do you believe – us or your own eyes ? ”
Moreover , for too many investors , Portugal , with its poor growth prospects and insufficient domestic savings to fund the public ##AT##-##AT## sector deficit , looks like Greece .
And Spain clearly has to grapple with its own Irish problem , namely a huge housing over ##AT##-##AT## hang – and probably large losses in the banking sector – following the collapse of an outsized real ##AT##-##AT## estate bubble .
The problems of Portugal and Spain might be less severe than those of Greece and Ireland , but this apparently is not enough to induce investors to buy their government debt .
A danger these countries share is thus the acute danger of large ##AT##-##AT## scale runs on their banking systems .
So far , investors trying to exit first have been made whole .
Holders of Greek debt maturing now are repaid courtesy of the € 110 billion bailout program , and holders of Irish bank bonds have been given a guarantee by the Irish government , whose promises have in turn been underwritten by the EFSF .
The EFSF will also provide funds to ensure that Irish banks ’ depositors can get their money back today .
The problem with this approach is that it creates the wrong incentives .
Investors have now learned that the first to sell will avoid losses .
The situation resembles that of a crowded cinema with only one exit .
Everyone knows that in case of fire , only the first to leave will be safe .
So , if the exit is small , even the faintest whiff of smoke can trigger a stampede .
But if the exit looks comfortably large , the public will be much more likely to remain calm , even if parts of the room are already filling with smoke .
For the financial market , the size of the exit depends on the funds available to make short ##AT##-##AT## term investors whole .
Unfortunately , the size of the EFSF looks inadequate to finance a collective exit by short ##AT##-##AT## term investors .
When the EFSF was created , it was assumed that the only problem was to ensure financing for the government deficits of the four prospective problem countries ( Portugal , Ireland , Greece , and Spain ) .
From this perspective , the headline figure of € 750 billion allocated to the EFSF looked adequate .
But the EFSF ’ s founders did not take into account banks ’ enormous short ##AT##-##AT## term liabilities , which in a crisis effectively become government debt , as Ireland has been the most recent to demonstrate .
The EFSF might be just enough to guarantee the public debt of the four problem countries , but certainly not their banking sectors ’ liabilities as well .
For example , the Spanish banking sector alone has short ##AT##-##AT## term liabilities of several hundred billion euros .
To return to the cinema analogy : investors know that the exit is not large enough to allow them all to squeeze through at the same time .
So each one want to be among the first to get out .
The official line so far has been “ no default , ” meaning no sovereign default or that of any bank can be considered .
If this line is to be maintained , the exit door must immediately be made much wider , and huge fire extinguishers must be brandished .
The International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank must show investors that they have enough funding to finance the simultaneous exit of all short ##AT##-##AT## term investors .
It could work .
A show of overwhelming force might restore calm to the markets .
But it is a risky proposition : if investors exit nonetheless , the required funds might be so large that creditor countries ’ taxpayers ’ revolt .
The alternative is to change strategy and focus instead on investors ’ incentives .
Patient investors should be rewarded .
In particular , they should be able to expect to be better off than those rushing to the exit .
This approach depends on two major policy shifts .
First , governments should not be pushed into insolvency just to save all banks .
This means that the Irish government ( maybe the next one ) should demand that holders of bank bonds share the losses , perhaps by offering them a simple debt ##AT##-##AT## equity swap .
Doubts about the Irish government ’ s solvency would then disappear quickly , and its guarantee of bank deposits would no longer look so shaky .
Something similar might have to be done for the Spanish banking system ’ s exposure to the local housing market .
The second component of a permanent anti ##AT##-##AT## crisis mechanism is a floor for bond prices – and thus a ceiling for losses .
The yields and volatility of longer ##AT##-##AT## term bonds should then fall relative to short ##AT##-##AT## term securities , allowing peripheral governments to finance themselves reliably and at reasonable cost .
None of this would resolve Europe ’ s fundamental problems , namely weak fiscal positions , poorly functioning financial sectors , and lack of competitiveness .
But all of them would be easier to manage with calmer financial markets .
TBILISI – Given the tremendous damage that Russia has inflicted on Georgia , it is easy to conclude that the Kremlin has achieved its objectives .
But , so far , Russia has failed in its real goal – getting rid of Mikheil Saakashvili , Georgia ’ s pro ##AT##-##AT## democracy , pro ##AT##-##AT## American president .
To be sure , Russia has tightened its control of the separatist enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . It shattered the Georgian military , grievously damaged Georgia ’ s economy , and stirred up discord within the Western alliance .
For three years , it has tried every conceivable tactic to bring Saakashvili down – fomenting a domestic uprising , imposing an economic blockade , beefing up its forces in the enclaves , and finally a war .
Yet Georgia ’ s president remains in power .
Here in Tbilisi , tension is understandably high .
Russian tanks are less than 25 miles away , and the wheat fields along the main road to Gori were ablaze , set on fire by Russian troops , as I drove through Russian checkpoints to get to that deserted , occupied city .
( Most memorable sight : drunken Russian soldiers in stolen Georgian uniforms – “ because they are better than ours . ” )
Russia ’ s invasion of Georgia has reshaped the strategic landscape .
But , as the West debates how to “ punish Russia , ” it is vital to remember that the main front is still in Georgia .
Talk about taking away the 2014 Winter Olympics or ejecting Russia from the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 may ( or may not ) have some effect on the Kremlin , but the most important thing the West can do now is strengthen the government in Tbilisi .
The equation is simple : if Saakashvili survives , Vladimir Putin loses .
The intense personal hatred between these men overlays two centuries of tortured history between Russia and Georgia .
Many people report that Putin simply “ loses it ” when discussing the upstart Saakashvili , who led his country from near bankruptcy into a golden age of economic growth and the world ’ s highest rate of foreign direct investment relative to GDP .
All this has been halted by Russian tanks .
The Kremlin has probably lost its chance to remove Saakashvili by overt force , although sinister , more stealthy means cannot be ruled out .
Having just dined with him in a public restaurant , I wish his security was a little tighter .
( His predecessor , Eduard Shevardnadze , was a near ##AT##-##AT## miss target for several assassination attempts that are widely believed to have been Russian ##AT##-##AT## directed . ) The Kremlin ’ s best hope now is that Georgia ’ s economy will crumble , its currency will collapse , and an unhappy populace , encouraged by some opposition leader ( perhaps bankrolled by Russia ) , will force Saakashvili from power .
The Western response to this challenge must go beyond rhetoric .
What matters most right now is massive economic and military assistance .
Public commitments to help rebuild Georgia are the best way to prevent Russia from achieving its goal .
Prime Minister Vladimir Gurgenidze estimates that rebuilding railroads , bridges , ports and other infrastructure will cost at least $ 1 billion ; this does not include humanitarian relief , refugee resettlement costs , or rebuilding Georgia ’ s military .
Gurgenidze also foresees negative economic growth , a huge budget deficit , and a collapse of tourism , which was just taking off in this beautiful country .
United States Senator Joseph Biden has called for an immediate $ 1 billion supplemental appropriation , a proposal quickly endorsed by Barack Obama .
But the Bush administration has not yet been specific on economic support .
Congress will be in session only briefly before the election , and a supplemental appropriation will pass only if President Bush pursues it vigorously as a bipartisan measure .
Even if delayed until next year , its immediate proposal by Bush and endorsement by both presidential candidates would help morale in Georgia .
The European Union , the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development must match American support .
In the long run , Georgia and Russia must coexist peacefully .
Here , Georgia must do its part .
Saakashvili , an immensely talented 41 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old , saved his country from utter collapse in 2003 . But he must think strategically about the future .
On occasion , he has berated the Europeans for insufficient support – not a good tactic for someone trying to join the EU – and has used rhetoric about Russia that , while understandable , only increases the danger to himself .
Saakashvili cannot pick up his tiny country and move it to Mexico .
He has to manage the situation with greater care .
There will be consequences , of course , for Russia ’ s relations with the West .
( Bush ’ s inattentiveness to this Russian threat – dramatically illustrated by his literal embrace of Putin in Beijing as Russian tanks rolled into Georgia – may have led the Kremlin to think it could get away with its invasion . )
While the West will not going to war over Georgia , Russia must understand that it will pay for using force , or the threat of force , against neighbors that were once part of the Soviet space .
This is especially true for Ukraine and Azerbaijan , which are likely to be Moscow ’ s next targets for intimidation .
The rules of the post ##AT##-##AT## Cold War world are changing – but not to the ultimate benefit of Russia , which has underestimated the unifying effect its actions will have on the West .
Exactly how these relationships evolve depends on what each side does in the coming weeks – especially in Georgia .
It is fashionable in Russia to disparage our fundamental shift in foreign policy that followed the terrorist attacks on the US last year .
According to this view , Russia sold its loyalty to the US ##AT##-##AT## led anti ##AT##-##AT## terror coalition too cheaply .
In exchange for more bilateral and multilateral financing , Russia now faces growing US military bases on its southern flank in Central Asia and the Caucasus , while NATO is poised to expand right up to our Western border .
But however justified criticism of growing US unilateralism may be--in the so ##AT##-##AT## called war on terrorism and elsewhere--the gravest risks facing Russia lie elsewhere .
The first concerns the most basic interest of any state : defense of its territorial integrity .
Here the most immediate threat is not posed by America or NATO , but by the European Union , whose enlargement means that member states will soon surround Russia &apos;s Kaliningrad region on all sides .
Russia &apos;s task is to ensure that this does not impede the free movement of people and goods between Kaliningrad and the rest of the country .
This is a vital condition for keeping the region Russian , and special EU transit visas should therefore be granted to Kaliningrad &apos;s residents in order to ensure simplified travel through adjacent EU countries .
The EU , however , does not want to give Kaliningrad &apos;s citizens such rights .
A solution must be found , not least because the EU &apos;s attitude to the Kaliningrad problem will be a litmus test of its desire for broader rapprochement with Russia .
Our mistake was to broach the subject of &quot; corridors &quot; linking Kaliningrad with the rest of Russia .
Poland immediately associated the idea with the pre ##AT##-##AT## war Danzig ( Gdansk ) Corridor and interpreted it as an ex ##AT##-##AT## territorial encroachment on Polish sovereignty .
But this is not so .
We are talking about transport routes for people and goods , nothing more .
Common sense should prevail .
The second risk facing Russia is no less daunting .
Owing to a steeply declining birth rate and falling life expectancy--largely the result of poor diet , widespread smoking , and alcohol abuse--Russia &apos;s population is contracting by nearly a million people per year .
Little , if anything , is being done to stem the demographic crisis , and it cannot be resolved by a higher birth rate alone ( although this is obviously an important factor ) .
Moreover , the crisis is aggravated by the uneven distribution of the population throughout Russia , with a near vacuum in the Far East and Siberia .
A vacuum never survives for long .
But can Russia manage to permit controlled and measured immigration ?
After all , the US gets a million new citizens annually from Latin America , mostly Mexico , and the Italian population grows annually by 90,000 Africans .
The difference is literally one of degrees - educational degrees .
When a well ##AT##-##AT## educated , skilled foreigner emigrates to the US , he or she can hope to obtain citizenship relatively soon .
Foreigners with less developed skills , on the other hand , must work diligently for several years to obtain permanent residency .
In Russia , we lack any such gradation .
So we need to formulate , jointly with neighboring countries , a legal framework for immigration .
Our policy should be explicitly designed to foster a more developed economic and social infrastructure in Eastern Russia .
Currently , those who want to settle in Russia emigrate overwhelmingly from the CIS countries , and 99 % of them settle in European Russia .
Unless we equalize conditions throughout the country , the already profound regional disparities will worsen .
This will require that we accept not only ex ##AT##-##AT## Soviet citizens but also Chinese and Korean immigrants .
The third challenge that Russia faces--one related to addressing its demographic crisis--is the need to diversify investment to ensure more even economic development , both geographically and by sector .
Capital that has accumulated in the raw materials sector in recent years should be shifted to manufacturing and infrastructure .
Currently , only oil production and export benefit from capital accumulation , whereas large sums are simply being sent out of the country .
President Vladimir Putin recently hinted that Russians with cash in offshore accounts may find their funds frozen pending audits of money suspected of assisting terrorist groups .
While Russia itself will not freeze accounts , President Putin &apos;s meaning was clear : it would be better for all sides if this money were brought home and invested in the national economy .
To achieve this end , Russia must create a secure and attractive investment climate .
Most importantly , if we are to reverse capital flight , the government must persuade individual savers that they can deposit money safely and withdraw it on demand .
How can the government expect to mobilize domestic investment as long as ordinary Russians keep their savings-- $ 50 billion , according to most estimates--at home ?
Russia &apos;s people need to be convinced of the country &apos;s political stability--that , for example , nobody will suggest nationalization , as happened repeatedly during the eight months that I was prime minister .
The model of socialism that existed in the Soviet Union is dead ; even the Communist Party does not seriously question the need for market economic relations .
But the manner in which the market is established and operates is another matter .
Unfortunately , central planning was not the only way to deepen Russia &apos;s backwardness relative to the West .
NEW YORK – Campaigns , be they political or military , are waged to be won , and the current American presidential campaign is no exception .
The Democratic and Republican candidates are doing all they can to distinguish themselves from an unpopular incumbent president and from one another in the remaining weeks before Americans vote .
For good reason , much attention is focused on foreign policy differences between the two nominees , which in many areas are both obvious and considerable .
Still , it is possible to discern some similarities between them , in part because some of their disagreements are not as pronounced as they seem , and in part because the constraints that the next president of the United States will face are certain to limit what either man could do in office .
Consider Iraq , the most divisive issue in American politics for the past five years .
Barack Obama regularly points out that the decision to go to war was deeply flawed ; John McCain emphasizes how much things have turned around since early 2007 , when US troop numbers were increased and US strategy revised .
Observers could be forgiven for thinking that they are speaking about two entirely different conflicts .
But what about the future ?
No matter who wins this November , it is clear that Iraq will not dominate US foreign policy in the years ahead to anything near the degree that it has in recent years .
We are entering the post ##AT##-##AT## Iraq era of American foreign policy .
Consistent with this , the US military presence is decreasing .
Where the two candidates differ is on the timing and pace of this drawdown , not on its general direction .
By contrast , the US commitment to Afghanistan will increase , and troop levels will climb .
Behind this prediction is a widely shared assessment that the trends in Afghanistan ( unlike in Iraq ) are negative , and that the US must strengthen its military presence there and revise its strategy if the Taliban are not to gain the upper hand .
It is also widely understood that Pakistan has become part of the problem .
Pakistan ’ s western reaches are now a sanctuary for militias and terrorists that are moving in and out of Afghanistan .
Here , Barack Obama appears more willing to have the US launch unilateral military raids against terrorists should the opportunity arise .
But whoever is elected will confront difficult choices if a nuclear ##AT##-##AT## armed Pakistan remains unable or unwilling to act as an American partner and meet its responsibilities in the effort against terrorism .
A third area of some consensus ( and some distance from George W. Bush ) is climate change .
Under the next president , the US will no longer be a drag on international efforts to create a global regime that sets a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions .
One result of this likely evolution in US policy is that pressure will shift to other countries , particularly China and India , to accept some limits on their own economic behavior .
A President McCain or Obama will take steps to improve America ’ s image in the world .
One of his first decisions will be to implement a ban on all forms of torture .
Also to be expected early on is a decision to close the facility at Guantánamo Bay , where terrorism suspects have been held for years without trial .
Iran is another area where the differences – at least initially – may not be as sharp as the campaign suggests .
Both candidates have stressed that an Iran with nuclear weapons would be unacceptable .
The victor will almost surely endorse a new diplomatic initiative aimed at ending Iran ’ s independent ability to enrich uranium .
Less clear are the details of such an initiative , or what the US would do if it were to fail .
The candidates ’ statements on Iran do suggest two different philosophies of diplomacy .
Obama seems to regard meeting with foreign leaders as a normal component of foreign policy , to be employed as one of many tools .
McCain appears to embrace the view that such meetings are something of a reward , to be offered when preconditions are met ( Iran comes to mind ) and withdrawn when certain lines are crossed , as Russia was judged to have done this August in Georgia .
Despite such differences , either would carry out policies closer to those of Bush ’ s second term than his first .
With a strained military and a struggling economy , the next president will often have little choice other than to talk .
On other issues , such as trade , there are distinctions between the candidates .
McCain is a stronger advocate of free trade than Obama is .
But this difference may have less impact than meets the eye .
Congress plays a large role in trade policy , and the near certainty that the Democratic Party ’ s majority in Congress will grow after the election means that protectionism will grow as well .
Difficult economic times will make it hard to generate support for trade pacts , despite the current importance of export ##AT##-##AT## oriented firms for the American economy .
There are real and important differences between the two candidates when it comes to how they would approach the world .
But there are also more similarities than might be evident from the debates and the campaign .
Aspects of the next president ’ s foreign policy are there to see if observers read between the lines and take as much note of what is not said as what is .
As Argentina &apos;s economy unravels in street demonstrations , food riots , and political tumult , conventional wisdom suggests that a lethal combination of reckless government spending and a fixed exchange rate is to blame .
Large fiscal deficits , so this argument goes , pumped up domestic demand , which fueled inflation and caused the peso to appreciate in real terms , even though it was pegged to the US dollar at a nominal one ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## one exchange rate .
As public debt grew , the government &apos;s only hope of paying it back was a deflationary clampdown on available money and credit--with a collapse in output , soaring unemployment , and civil disorder almost inevitable .
This line of reasoning is plausible , because exchange rate misalignment may indeed be at the heart of Argentina &apos;s problems ( albeit for very different reasons that we will not explore here , one associated with a sudden stop in capital flows ) .
But fiscal profligacy alone cannot explain Argentina &apos;s meltdown .
Throughout the 1990s , Argentina &apos;s budget deficit never exceeded 2 % of GDP , with the exception of 1999 , when it rose to 2.5 % , before falling back to 2.4 % in 2000 .
While public ##AT##-##AT## sector borrowing pushed external debt from 28.4 % of GDP in 1991 to 51.4 % in 2000 , this still compares favorably with countries renowned for their fiscal probity .
The European Union , for example , requires its member states to cap budget deficits and public debt , respectively , at 3 % and 60 % of GDP .
Moreover , like Argentina &apos;s dollar peg , most EU countries abandoned control over their exchange rates by adopting the euro .
Yet no one suggests that Germany , France , or Italy risk sharing Argentina &apos;s fate .
One key difference between Argentina and the EU is the huge risk premium that Argentina must pay for its debt , which imposes much narrower limits on the sustainability of its fiscal deficits .
Indeed , in 2000 , interest payments on the public debt equaled 16.5 % of Argentina &apos;s total budget revenues .
Why , then , was Argentina treated so differently in 2001 ?
Something essential is missing from the conventional story : money and banking .
Like other emerging market economies , liberalizing reforms in the early 1990s attracted massive inflows of foreign credit .
But after robust economic growth in 1991 ##AT##-##AT## 94 , Argentina was hit by the Mexican crisis , which produced capital flight , a run on bank deposits , and a severe , but short ##AT##-##AT## lived , recession .
Argentina &apos;s main response - encouraging large ##AT##-##AT## scale foreign investment in the banking sector - sought to ensure that this would not happen again , given that there would now be an international lender of last resort .
With confidence restored , real GDP growth rebounded strongly , reaching 8.1 % in 1997 .
With a largely foreign ##AT##-##AT## owned - and thus well ##AT##-##AT## capitalized - banking sector , Argentina remained insulated from the sudden reversals of capital flows that fueled crises in emerging markets after 1997 .
But soon after taking the helm at the Economics Ministry in March 2001 , Domingo Cavallo pointed an accusing finger at the central bank .
Notwithstanding the fixed exchange rate , which limited monetary growth to that of the bank &apos;s dollar reserves , he argued that economic recovery required an expansionary credit policy .
The standard view among economists is that relaxing monetary policy under a fixed exchange rate regime will cause capital to flee , especially when investors are already jittery about the effects of a devaluation in a largely dollarized economy , which typically involves a bank bailout and a loss in reserves to pay for it .
Pedro Pou , Argentina &apos;s central bank president and a strong defender of the standard view , was sacked , and the bank increased credit sharply .
Unfortunately , the conventional view was right .
By December 2001 , international reserves fell to less than half their January level , with credit expansion accounting for about 53 % of the loss . ( meanwhile , the spread on government bonds jumped from 973 to 4435 points ) .
The rest was due to an 18 % decline in deposits , with the loss of confidence mainly hitting state ##AT##-##AT## owned banks .
Since their deposits far exceeded Argentina &apos;s international reserves , the central bank &apos;s decision to prop up their reserves with fresh injections of credit reinforced expectations that the fixed exchange rate was doomed .
Worse still , in order to compensate for the credit expended on intervention , the monetary authorities hiked the banks &apos; reserve requirements for new deposits , a measure that affected mostly foreign banks who were receiving deposits escaping from public banks .
Therefore , foreign banks , fearful of further intervention and / or confiscation , refused to replenish their local subsidiaries &apos; reserves ( thus , the answer to the question , why didn &apos;t foreign banks act as a lender of last resort ? ) .
This destroyed what little confidence in the banking system remained .
As foreign reserves continued to plummet , the peso &apos;s devaluation became inevitable .
Would Argentina be better off had it floated the peso long before all this ?
Such a move might have prevented the peso from becoming so overvalued that investors lost confidence in the country &apos;s ability to pay its debts .
But without a credible monetary policy , floating the currency would have merely stoked hyperinflation .
So the key lesson here is that the type of exchange rate regime is secondary to the credibility required to sustain it .
Clearly , heterodox monetary policy was far from credible , and it turned out to be the main culprit behind Argentina &apos;s final collapse .
Guillermo Calvo is Chief Economist at the Inter ##AT##-##AT## American Development Bank and Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland where he is Director of the Center for International Economics ;
The latest edition of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey shows that favorable opinions of the United States have fallen again in 12 out of 15 countries polled , a sad reflection of a country ’ s loss of image .
How can America recover international legitimacy ?
This is probably one of the most important challenges for today ’ s world , for America retains a unique power that should be used – and be perceived – as a force for good if global stability is to prevail .
Nearly two decades after the demise of the Soviet empire , what stands out is a prevailing sense of lost opportunities .
The US had a unique opportunity at the end of the Cold War to use its benevolent and enlightened superiority to establish a better international order .
But , for a combination of political and personal reasons , America lost time under the two presidencies of Bill Clinton .
Indeed , during this necessarily short and fragile “ unipolar moment , ” Clinton probably had an intuition of what America ’ s new responsibilities should be , but he did not deliver .
The defeat of the Democrats in the mid ##AT##-##AT## term elections in 1994 , followed by the Monica Lewinsky affair , hampered the effectiveness of one of America ’ s most energetic and gifted Presidents .
That failure was epitomized by the inability to impose a peace agreement on Palestinians and Israelis in 2000 .
By contrast , George W. Bush did not lose time .
He did worse : he simply took a wrong turn – and he took it before 9 / 11 , a traumatic event that reinforced , but did not create , America ’ s Manichean view of itself and its role in the world .
Three recent examples illustrate what went wrong with America , its loss of unique status , and its growing image as a partisan and unethical , if not destabilizing , force in the world .
Consider , first , the recent nuclear agreement signed between the US and India .
In strictly legal terms , there is nothing wrong , since India never signed the Nuclear Non ##AT##-##AT## Proliferation Treaty .
But in psychological and political terms , the deal signed could only be perceived as legitimizing for Iran ’ s nuclear ambitions , not to mention North Korea ’ s .
It was the ultimate proof that the Bush administration does not believe in universal norms .
A “ good ” country would be treated with extreme leniency , whereas a “ bad ” country would not .
Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib , and more recent war ##AT##-##AT## crimes scandals have done much worse damage to America ’ s stature .
Regimes that systematically violate human rights have been quick to seize on every episode of US wrongdoing .
With its own human rights record in question , the US , which had been the democratic teacher of the post ##AT##-##AT## war world , is in a much weaker position to give lessons and set standards .
Nor does the appearance of hypocrisy end there .
At a time when “ democracy ” and “ democratization ” have become the watchwords of US foreign policy , normalization of diplomatic relations with Gaddafi ’ s Libya , not to mention leniency towards Egypt and Saudi Arabia hardly boosts America ’ s credibility .
In global terms , the contrast between what America says and what it does has become glaring .
In February 2005 , in a major speech in Paris during her first foreign trip as Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice stated America ’ s ambition in the world .
She said essentially the following : “ The role of the world is to improve the world .
America , as the most powerful and ethical country in the world , has a unique responsibility to perform . ”
Eighteen months later , the results are falling far short of the goal .
On the contrary , the failures of US policy have contributed to reduce the legitimacy of America ’ s power further .
Despite the recent death of Zarqawi in Iraq , the situation there , and in Afghanistan , does not justify the continued Bush administration ’ s optimism .
As America ’ s legitimacy diminishes , new actors are appearing on the world stage – or returning for an encore .
Russia and China today are united not only by their energy deals , but also by both countries ’ conviction that their time has come , and that the outside world needs them more than they need the outside world , particularly the US .
In strategic terms , the waning influence of a paralyzed Europe is also very bad news for America .
The US needs allies now more than ever , for the world is reverting to its pre ##AT##-##AT## war multi ##AT##-##AT## polar state .
Of course , given America ’ s objective military superiority , I would call it “ asymmetrical multi ##AT##-##AT## polarity . ” But the US is no longer the country that others seek to emulate , or that they look to for global leadership .
It is too early to dismiss America and proclaim the end of an imperial moment .
America retains unique qualities – particularly its ability to rebound .
The next US president should be able to capitalize on Americans ’ fundamental optimism , pragmatism , and activism .
But he or she will face an uphill struggle to prove to the world that America can be a force for good , a democratic beacon that cares for the planet and that lives up to the standards that it sets for others .
A lot of public attention and worry nowadays surrounds the new risks that globalization and information technology create for our wages and livelihoods .
But there has been far less constructive discussion of new ideas about how to confront these risks .
In fact , we might be losing the momentum we had a few years ago to implement some of these ideas .
To be sure , we still sympathize with people who , upon reaching middle age or later , find themselves replaced by lower ##AT##-##AT## paid workers in another part of the world , if not by a computer or a robot .
But are we really going to do anything about these risks ?
One new idea that seemed hot a few years ago is “ wage insurance . ”
As then floated , the idea was simple : the government would protect people from the risk of losing their job and being unable to find a new one at the same wage .
A government insurance program would pay these people a fraction , say , half , the difference between their old pay and their pay in a new job for a specified period , such as two years .
The idea was first proposed by Robert Z. Lawrence and Robert Litan in their 1986 book , Saving Free Trade , andrevived in a 2001 article by Litan and Lori Kletzer .
The proposal generated interest .
A demonstration program was adopted in the United States in 2002 . In 2002 , the Hartz Commission recommended a version of it in Germany .
Wage insurance programs have been actively talked about or actually implemented in some form in Britain , France , Switzerland , and Ireland .
Despite all the intellectual applause , however , wage insurance programs are still not a significant force in the world economy .
They should be .
But they should also be supplemented by other devices .
One advantage of wage insurance is that it may be a more effective way to subsidize on ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## job training than traditional government ##AT##-##AT## run vocational training programs .
Often , after completing a government ##AT##-##AT## sponsored program , participants find it impossible to secure a job with the promised higher pay .
Far better , proponents of wage insurance argue , for the training to be carried out by an employer who wants a job done and knows what the employee needs to learn .
It seems plausible that two years is long enough for retraining , after which the employee might command a higher wage without a government subsidy .
But governments , fearing the expense of wage insurance if a lot of people exploit it , have not been willing to implement it on a large scale .
For example , the US wage insurance program is confined to manufacturing workers over age 50 who are in competitively vulnerable industries and are deemed by the Secretary of Labor to have nontransferable skills .
Moreover , the benefit is capped at $ 5,000 per year .
The program has practically been forgotten , and will expire next year unless it is renewed .
With government deficits the norm , that appears unlikely .
The way to regain lost momentum is to recognize that wage insurance is only one of several new ideas for insuring the emerging risks of this century .
The weakness of the current wage insurance proposal is that it pays benefits only for a limited period and relies for its long ##AT##-##AT## term effect on the retraining incentives that it creates .
In reality , however , losing a high ##AT##-##AT## paying job may be a lifetime event , and the supposed retraining that wage insurance would encourage for a laid ##AT##-##AT## off 50 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old worker often may be ineffective .
In my 2003 book , New Financial Order : Risk in the 21st Century , I proposed a different idea , which I called “ livelihood insurance . ”
As the name implies , livelihood insurance is designed to provide more than just a brief respite or a subsidy for retraining .
It is aimed at dealing with long ##AT##-##AT## term changes in the labor market , rather than assuring temporary wage levels .
It would also rely on the market rather than a government program .
With livelihood insurance , a private insurer would pay a stream of income to a policyholder if an index of average income in the insured person ’ s occupation and region declines substantially .
Moreover , this income stream would continue for as long as the index stays down , not just for a couple of years ( or any other arbitrary period ) .
In other words , this insurance policy would protect against lifetime income risks .
One reason why government ##AT##-##AT## run wage insurance programs must have limited duration is that they involve so ##AT##-##AT## called “ moral hazard ” : the risk that people will get lazy or would take easier , lower ##AT##-##AT## paying jobs and continue to collect insurance that pays them the wage of a more demanding occupation .
But this would not apply to livelihood insurance , because its benefits are tied to the rise and fall of income indices , which are beyond the control of individuals .
Livelihood insurance would also have another advantage .
Since the premium would be determined by the market , it would be higher in occupations that the market believes to be in danger from outsourcing or technical change .
This , in turn , would give workers a tangible warning and an incentive to anticipate job losses before they occur .
This is not to say that wage insurance is a bad idea , or that it should not be implemented on a wider scale .
Both wage and livelihood insurance appear to have important risk management functions .
Indeed , for the future , it is imperative to think about many new ways , involving both government and the market , to ensure that we manage better the greatest personal risks now faced by workers around the world .
NEW YORK – Here ’ s a concept you ’ ve probably never heard of : “ viral sovereignty . ”
This dangerous idea comes to us courtesy of Indonesia ’ s minister of health , Siti Fadilah Supari , who asserts that deadly viruses are the sovereign property of individual nations – even though they cross borders and could pose a pandemic threat to all the world ’ s peoples .
Political leaders around the world should take note – and take very strong action .
The vast majority of avian flu outbreaks in the past four years , in both humans and poultry , have occurred in Indonesia .
At least 53 types of H5N1 bird flu viruses have appeared in chickens and people there , according to the World Health Organization .
Yet , since 2005 , Indonesia has shared with the WHO samples from only two of the more than 135 people known to have been infected with H5N1 ( 110 of whom have died ) .
Worse , Indonesia is no longer providing the WHO with timely notification of bird flu outbreaks or human cases .
Since 2007 , its government has openly defied international health regulations and a host of other WHO agreements to which Indonesia is a signatory .
Moreover , Indonesia ’ s government is threatening to close down United States Naval Medical Research Unit Two ( NAMRU ##AT##-##AT## 2 ) , a public health laboratory staffed by Indonesians and US military scientists .
NAMRU ##AT##-##AT## 2 is one of the world ’ s best disease surveillance facilities , providing health officials worldwide with vital , transparent information .
Indonesia ’ s government has accused NAMRU ##AT##-##AT## 2 scientists of everything from profiting from its “ sovereign ” viruses to manufacturing the H5N1 bird flu as part of an alleged biological warfare scheme .
There is no evidence to support these outlandish claims .
A year ago , Supari ’ s assertions about “ viral sovereignty ” seemed anomalous .
Disturbingly , however , the notion has morphed into a global movement , fueled by self ##AT##-##AT## destructive , anti ##AT##-##AT## Western sentiments .
In May , Indian Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss endorsed the concept in a dispute with Bangladesh , and the Non ##AT##-##AT## Aligned Movement – a 112 ##AT##-##AT## nation organization that is a survivor of the Cold War era – has agreed to consider formally endorsing it at its November meeting .
Indonesia argues that a nation ’ s right to control all information on locally discovered viruses should be protected through the same mechanisms that the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization uses to guarantee poor countries ’ rights of ownership and patents on the seeds of its indigenous plants .
Under the FAO seed accord , a nation can register plants , share their seeds , and derive profits from resulting products .
This useful policy reduces exploitative practices that sometimes enable multinational corporations and wealthy governments to obtain outrageous profits from indigenous agriculture .
It is dangerous folly , however , to extend this policy to viruses .
If the concept of “ viral sovereignty ” had been applied to HIV 25 years ago , we would not have central repositories of thousands of varieties of HIV today ; these allow scientists to test drugs and vaccines against all the different strains of the virus that causes AIDS .
It is even more ludicrous to extend the sovereignty notion to viruses that , like flu , can be carried across international borders by migratory birds .
In this age of globalization , failure to make viral samples freely available risks allowing the emergence of a new strain of influenza that could go unnoticed until it is capable of exacting the sort of toll taken by the pandemic that killed tens of millions in 1918 .
As the world learned with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) – which first appeared in China in 2002 but was not reported by Chinese officials until it spread to four other nations – globally shared health risks demand absolute global transparency .
There is strong evidence from a variety of sources that forms of the bird flu virus circulating in Indonesia are more virulent than those elsewhere and that in a few cases they may have spread directly from one person to another .
The WHO has tried for two years to accommodate Indonesia , without success .
Under pressure from scientists worldwide , Indonesia agreed in June to share genetic data on some of its viral samples , but not the actual microbes .
Without access to the viruses , it is impossible to verify the accuracy of such genetic information or to develop vaccines against the deadly microbes .
Outrageously , Supari has charged that the WHO would give any viruses – not just H5N1 – to drug companies , which in turn would make products designed to sicken poor people , in order “ to prolong their profitable business by selling new vaccines ” ( a charge oddly reminiscent of the plot of John le Carré ’ s novel The Constant Gardener ) .
The WHO elicited pledges from the world ’ s major drug companies not to exploit international repositories of genetic data for commercial benefit , but this has not satisfied Indonesia .
Indonesia ’ s claim that NAMRU ##AT##-##AT## 2 is a biological weapons facility must be confronted head ##AT##-##AT## on .
The US ambassador to Indonesia , Cameron Hume , is actively trying to prevent a catastrophe .
So far , there has been insufficient support from senior US officials .
They must get involved .
And China must use its substantial influence with Indonesia on this issue – in its own self ##AT##-##AT## interest .
Failure to share potentially pandemic viral strains with world health agencies is morally reprehensible .
Allowing Indonesia and other countries to turn this issue into another rich ##AT##-##AT## poor , Islamic ##AT##-##AT## Western dispute would be tragic – and could lead to a devastating health crisis anywhere and at any time .
How do we judge the quality of public services ?
That question is far trickier than it appears .
In some cases the answer seems simple enough : whether trains run on time .
But is this really all we want from our trains ?
Surely not .
They should be safe , too , and reasonably comfortable .
They should run not only on time , but at the right time and at reasonable intervals .
More important still , they should be affordable .
As the list of criteria grows longer , it becomes evident that the most easily measured component , punctuality , is but one of many desirable features , and not necessarily the most significant .
This example is relevant for the politics of public services , which dominates debate in many countries because it lies at the heart of the big problems of both government budgets ( and cutting them back ) and taxes ( and their reduction ) .
In keeping with the spirit of the times , governments introduce business criteria for measuring the efficiency--and the &quot; success , &quot; more generally--of public services .
This means , above all , that they set performance targets .
So ministers proclaim that street crime will be halved by next spring , or that the proportion of each generation going to universities will be raised to 50 % in five years . Waiting lists for hospital beds will be cut by one ##AT##-##AT## third within two years .
This method of governance makes it appear that , at long last , we can hold politicians accountable by establishing whether targets have been reached or not .
But is this what we really want ?
The examples just given are taken from real life .
In real life , however , performance targets also have curious side effects .
Cutting hospital waiting lists has led doctors to treat minor illnesses more quickly , leaving those with more serious conditions off the lists altogether .
The rapid increase in university students has led to declines in admission standards and the quality of final degrees .
Reducing street crime encouraged the police to stop registering certain offenses altogether .
In short , because the availability of government support depends on achieving seemingly precise targets , the incentive to aim for apparent rather than real success becomes an almost overwhelming temptation .
Moreover , many public services are so ##AT##-##AT## called &quot; soft services . &quot;
Hospital care entails much more than a well ##AT##-##AT## functioning conveyor belt for surgical operations .
Education is in all cases about more than achieving a certain &quot; throughput . &quot;
Social services generally need time , not least the time of caregivers , and their time is often required in unpredictable bursts--a fact utterly at odds with target ##AT##-##AT## mania .
Obviously , public money must not be wasted .
But , even here , questions arise .
Consider publicly ##AT##-##AT## funded scientific research .
It is in the nature of such research that it proceeds by trial and error .
For every road to new discoveries , there will be several negative results and cul ##AT##-##AT## de ##AT##-##AT## sacs .
If only highly targeted research with guaranteed success is funded , the probability must be high that innovative researchers emigrate to countries or institutions that have a more generous and appropriate approach to the relationship between funding and success .
While all this may be true , the question remains : how do we make sure that public services are run with reasonable efficiency and produce the results intended by governments and expected by taxpayers ?
One answer has to do with input rather than outcomes--that is , with the quality and ethos of those running our public services and working in them .
Here the business analogy is simply not sufficient .
The old French administrative training for public services taught both relevant skills and an ethos of civic commitment .
The old civil service in countries like Britain or Germany embraced an approach to their tasks that made it a matter of honor to perform well .
Self ##AT##-##AT## interest and charity are not the only human motivations ; there is also the motive of service , and it needs to be cultivated .
At the other end--that of results--some targets do make sense .
Trains should run on time .
But beyond that is the human judgment of those most affected .
This is why parents &apos; councils for schools , or committees of users of public transport , or patients &apos; boards for hospitals are crucial .
Such bodies may seem weak at first sight .
They may even be regarded as a nuisance by professionals .
In fact , however , they provide an invaluable check on sloppy and inefficient providers of public services .
We must beware of overly business ##AT##-##AT## guided approaches to public service .
At certain times and in certain countries , services that need not be public had to be privatized and run along business lines in order to make them run better--or to keep them running at all .
But core public services in health , education , transport , and a few other areas will forever be just that , services , and will therefore need to be appreciated in more complex ways than meeting measurable targets .
BERLIN – The multipolar nature of today ’ s international system will again be on display at the upcoming G ##AT##-##AT## 20 summit in Los Cabos , Mexico .
Global problems are no longer solved , crises managed , or global rules defined , let alone implemented , the old ##AT##-##AT## fashioned way , by a few , mostly Western , powers .
Incipient great and middle powers , such as India , Brazil , Indonesia , South Korea , Turkey , and South Africa , also demand their say .
Some of these powers are still emerging economies .
Politically , however , most of them have crossed the threshold that has long limited their access to the kitchen of international decision ##AT##-##AT## making .
The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council ( the “ P ##AT##-##AT## 5 ” ) still defend their right to veto resolutions , and their military power is unmatched .
But they can no longer dispose of sufficient resources , competence , and legitimacy to cope with global challenges or crises on their own .
Bipolarity is a thing of the past , and it is unlikely to re ##AT##-##AT## emerge in a new Sino ##AT##-##AT## American “ G ##AT##-##AT## 2 . ”
It is equally unlikely for the foreseeable future that any one club of countries , such as the G ##AT##-##AT## 7 or G ##AT##-##AT## 8 , will again assume a quasi ##AT##-##AT## hegemonic position .
Even the G ##AT##-##AT## 20 in its current composition may not really represent the forces that can and will shape the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century .
For the Unites States , the European Union , Japan , and other members of the “ Old West , ” the good news is that most of the emerging powers that are positioning themselves for a more active global role are also democracies .
Within the G ##AT##-##AT## 20 , only two states – China and Saudi Arabia – explicitly do not want to be liberal democracies , while a third , Russia , has developed into an autocracy with a democratic façade .
The not ##AT##-##AT## so ##AT##-##AT## good news is that these new democratic powers do not necessarily share the Old West ’ s political agenda .
For example , they differ about climate policies , seeing a threat to development .
Similarly , while new middle and great powers do not always agree , they are generally more skeptical of both international sanctions and military interventions .
Moreover , some of the most important of these states differ substantially with the US , and often also with the EU , about the right approach toward regional conflicts , especially in the Middle East .
Thus , in 2010 , the US found itself in a serious diplomatic dispute with Turkey and Brazil about how to resolve the conflict with Iran over its nuclear program .
Without actually admitting it , the US was clearly unhappy that these two states tried to play a diplomatic role of their own in the dispute .
Differences are also apparent where new democratic middle or great powers have formed new groups or clubs , such as the BRICS , together with non ##AT##-##AT## democratic powers .
India , Brazil , and South Africa are using such formats in a pragmatic way to pursue their interests , or simply to demonstrate their increased international weight .
There is little agreement between them and Russia or China – both P ##AT##-##AT## 5 members – with regard to political values or to fundamental questions of international order .
Along with many other states in the global South , however , Russia and China tend to defend the principle of non ##AT##-##AT## interference , and they are generally reluctant to support any US or European attempts to project democracy or defend human rights in other countries .
Not a few policymakers in the US and in Europe have reacted with astonishment , or even annoyance , to these emerging democratic powers ’ attempts to pursue their own agendas on the world stage .
Such reactions partly reflect old thinking rooted in the Cold War , when democratic countries might differ over details , but would agree about the main questions of international politics .
Those who pursued a different agenda on substantial matters were either not part of the “ democratic camp ” or were not important international players .
By contrast , a central feature of today ’ s globalized , multipolar world is that shared democratic values do not guarantee agreement about substantial questions of international politics .
The more democracies there are , the more conflicts of interests and differences are likely to emerge between democratic countries .
There is little reason to react with anger when states like Turkey , Brazil , and South Africa set priorities different from those of Europe or the US , or have different views about how to deal with the Arab ##AT##-##AT## Israeli conflict , Iran , development aid , democracy promotion , or environmental protection .
The US example shows clearly that democratic great powers often pursue their interests with little regard for a global common good that others have defined .
In other words , the international order is becoming more pluralistic .
The task for established Western democracies is to accept and cope with such “ democratic differences ” on the international level , and to seek multilateral coalitions to manage or solve problems .
In principle , the EU is better positioned than the US ( and certainly than China ) to take on this task .
Europeans are well practiced in dealing with differences and shaping consensus among principally like ##AT##-##AT## minded states .
That said , Europe needs to learn to be clearer and more transparent about the interests underlying its own policies , rather than suggesting that its positions on a specific subject represent the only rational implementation of democratic values and norms .
PRINCETON – Of all the arguments against voluntary euthanasia , the most influential is the “ slippery slope ” : once we allow doctors to kill patients , we will not be able to limit the killing to those who want to die .
There is no evidence for this claim , even after many years of legal physician ##AT##-##AT## assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg , Switzerland , and the American state of Oregon .
But recent revelations about what took place in a New Orleans hospital after Hurricane Katrina point to a genuine danger from a different source .
When New Orleans was flooded in August 2005 , the rising water cut off Memorial Medical Center , a community hospital that was holding more than 200 patients .
Three days after the hurricane hit , the hospital had no electricity , the water supply had failed , and toilets could no longer be flushed .
Some patients who were dependent on ventilators died .
In stifling heat , doctors and nurses were hard ##AT##-##AT## pressed to care for surviving patients lying on soiled beds .
Adding to the anxiety were fears that law and order had broken down in the city , and that the hospital itself might be a target for armed bandits .
Helicopters were called in to evacuate patients .
Priority was given to those who were in better health , and could walk .
State police arrived and told staff that because of the civil unrest , everybody had to be out of the hospital by 5 p.m.
On the eighth floor , Jannie Burgess , a 79 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old woman with advanced cancer , was on a morphine drip and close to death .
To evacuate her , she would have to be carried down six flights of stairs , and would require the attention of nurses who were needed elsewhere .
But if she were left unattended , she might come out of her sedation , and be in pain .
Ewing Cook , one of the physicians present , instructed the nurse to increase the morphine , “ giving her enough until she goes . ”
It was , he later told Sheri Fink , who recently published an account of these events in The New York Times , a “ no ##AT##-##AT## brainer . ”
According to Fink , Anna Pou , another physician , told nursing staff that several patients on the seventh floor were also too ill to survive .
She injected them with morphine and another drug that slowed their breathing until they died .
At least one of the patients injected with this lethal combination of drugs appears to have otherwise been in little danger of imminent death . Emmett Everett was a 61 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old man who had been paralyzed in an accident several years earlier , and was in the hospital for surgery to relieve a bowel obstruction .
When others from his ward were evacuated , he asked not to be left behind .
But he weighed 380 pounds ( 173 kilograms ) , and it would have been extremely difficult to carry him down the stairs and then up again to where the helicopters were landing .
He was told the injection he was being given would help with the dizziness from which he suffered .
In 1957 , a group of doctors asked Pope Pius XII whether it is permissible to use narcotics to suppress pain and consciousness “ if one foresees that the use of narcotics will shorten life . ”
The Pope said that it was .
In its Declaration on Euthanasia , issued in 1980 , the Vatican reaffirmed that view .
The Vatican ’ s position is an application of what is known as “ the doctrine of double effect . ”
An action that has two effects , one good and the other bad , may be permissible if the good effect is the one that is intended and the bad effect is merely an unwanted consequence of achieving the good effect .
Significantly , neither the Pope ’ s remarks , nor the Declaration on Euthanasia , place any emphasis on the importance of obtaining the voluntary and informed consent of patients , where possible , before shortening their lives .
According to the doctrine of double effect , two doctors may , to all outward appearances , do exactly the same thing : that is , they may give patients in identical conditions an identical dose of morphine , knowing that this dose will shorten the patient ’ s life . Yet one doctor , who intends to relieve the patient ’ s pain , acts in accordance with good medical practice , whereas the other , who intends to shorten the patient ’ s life , commits murder .
Dr. Cook had little time for such subtleties .
Only “ a very naïve doctor ” would think that giving a person a lot of morphine was not “ prematurely sending them to their grave , ” he told Fink , and then bluntly added : “ We kill ‘ em . ”
In Cook ’ s opinion , the line between something ethical and something illegal is “ so fine as to be imperceivable . ”
At Memorial Medical Center , physicians and nurses found themselves under great pressure .
Exhausted after 72 hours with little sleep , and struggling to care for their patients , they were not in the best position to make difficult ethical decisions .
The doctrine of double effect , properly understood , does not justify what the doctors did ; but , by inuring them to the practice of shortening patients ’ lives without obtaining consent , it seems to have paved the way for intentional killing .
Roman Catholic thinkers have been among the most vocal in invoking the “ slippery slope ” argument against the legalization of voluntary euthanasia and physician ##AT##-##AT## assisted dying .
They would do well to examine the consequences of their own doctrines .
NEW YORK – The US dollar is plunging , the economy is imploding , and a crisis of identity is shaking countries around the world .
So , what are Americans obsessed with at this critical moment ?
“ Octamom ” : the saga of Nadya Suleman , a young single mother in Los Angeles who , having already given birth to seven children , underwent fertility treatments and is now bringing home octuplets .
The story would ordinarily be a mere curiosity .
But , ever since Suleman hit the news stream , dozens of media outlets have begun to report , with a kind of obsessive revulsion , on her every move .
And , as if being called “ Octamom ” weren ’ t bad enough , pop stars such as Cher have come forward to denounce her ; blogs have been created to track the details of her plastic surgery ; and entertainment Web sites have sent reporters to stalk her and write shaming exposés of her sojourn at an expensive cosmetics counter .
It is true that there is plenty to condemn : Suleman ’ s family lives on food stamps , the children already at home don ’ t have enough baby furniture , and her own parents are giving interviews to the media in which they criticize her choices .
Her publicist quit , calling her “ crazy . ”
There have been plenty of oddball flash ##AT##-##AT## in ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## pan media stars in US popular culture before Suleman .
But her story just goes on and on , and the emotion that attaches to it seems strangely furious and vengeful .
I believe that Americans ’ obsession with Suleman is a projection of their own guilt and shame at their recent choices .
Suleman does not have a decent job , but she managed to invest in costly fertility treatments and could afford many expensive cosmetic surgeries .
Worse yet , her surgeries seem designed to make her resemble the actress Angelina Jolie .
She somehow has a spacious house , but no proper beds for the kids .
In other times , it would have been the absence of a man that turned Suleman into an object of public scorn .
Today , that scarcely registers against the other themes : a working ##AT##-##AT## class or unemployed person dared to aspire to resemble someone of too high a status , and spent too much money conceiving too many blameless babies who deserve protection and care , and who have now been put at risk by their mother ’ s selfish choices .
Bewitched by symbols of affluence and a level of consumption that she could not afford , she acted like a child herself , with no thought to the future .
Sound familiar ?
Sound like anyone you know ?
Right now , Americans are staggering from the reality of what they themselves have done .
The real estate bubble inflated and collapsed partly because millions of Americans borrowed more than they could afford to repay – and knew it .
It takes nothing away from the pain of those now losing their houses to notice that something oddly American and a bit perverse happened : millions of Americans were seduced by fantasies of a beautiful big house , vague about their own plans for the future , and yet full of crazy confidence that it would all somehow work out .
American optimism became as much a curse as a blessing .
The credit freeze is partly the work of bankers and hedge fund managers who acted just like Nadya Suleman , leveraging the present for an unrealizable future .
But it is also the result of ordinary Americans , who ran up more credit card debt than any previous generation .
In the mall , or at home on the Internet , Americans acted like Nadya Suleman , too : seduced by the bag , the shoes , the beauty treatments , the vacations , and the life that the stars they admire take for granted .
And , with education and health care faltering and social security funding at risk , their kids , like Suleman ’ s , are now endangered partly because of their own choices .
The manageable , honorable American Dream of the 1950 ’ s – a decent , affordable college education ; a small house of one ’ s own ; hope that one ’ s children will be better off than oneself – was misplaced in the last decade and a half .
In the new , reality ##AT##-##AT## show version of that dream , countless Americans came to expect to be able to live , look , dance , and party like celebrities , or else feel themselves to be failures .
Enough is not enough anymore .
That is the American Dream that Nadya Suleman bought into , and , in their obsession with her , Americans are coming to grips with how seriously they went astray .
Indeed , a strange sense of relief is now creeping into Americans ’ consciousness as the consumer economy grinds to a halt .
The relief comes from not aspiring to spend like Suleman , or Britney Spears , or the neighbors down the street .
It comes from the thought that this really might be enough to be able to afford a small house , a college education , and the children that one already has .
Not long ago , an American political analyst compared France ’ s loss of influence in Europe following its “ No ” vote in the 2005 referendum on the EU constitutional treaty with France ’ s surrender in 1940 .
A provocative analogy , but is it apt ?
The collapse in 1940 revealed the fragility of France ’ s democracy and its loss of confidence in the country ’ s capacity to face outside threats .
In rejecting the European constitution , France expressed its fear of , among other things , globalization .
A better analogy for the No vote was the rejection in 1954 of the treaty to establish a European Defense Community ( EDC ) .
In both cases , a major historical mistake was made .
France had to a large extent initiated both treaties , had managed to get them accepted by its European partners , but in the end vetoed its own undertakings .
Why , in both 1954 and 2005 , did the French – in one case the National Assembly , in the other the electorate – reject proposals that France itself had conceived ?
Both projects sought to construct a genuinely supranational Europe .
The EDC would have created a European army , in which even German troops would have been included .
The proposed defense treaty was also to be buttressed by plans for a European political community whose main features were to be defined by a constitutional commission made up of members of national parliaments .
In effect , this commission would have been the precursor to the 2003 ##AT##-##AT## 2004 Convention for the Future of Europe , which , presided over by former French President Valéry Giscard d ’ Estaing drafted the constitutional treaty .
The political community of the 1950 ’ s that France had persuaded its five European partners to accept was supposed to absorb both the European Coal and Steel Community and the EDC .
It was to have both diplomatic and military powers , as well as a legislative assembly much like today ’ s European Parliament – just as the 2005 EU constitutional plan would have extended the European Parliament ’ s powers and created a European minister of foreign affairs .
But now , as back then , fear and doubt won the day .
Political parties and others who mobilized opposition to the EDC feared a remilitarized Germany and a threat to France ’ s sovereignty .
Today , those in France who opposed the EU constitution succeeded in stigmatizing “ Europe ” as the threat .
They trumpeted France ’ s invasion by “ Polish plumbers , ” calling into question Europe ’ s two principal achievements : the introduction of a single market , which has undeniably boosted the French economy , and EU enlargement , which has done so much to foster democratic transition in new member states .
But the failure of the referendum in France carries more serious consequences than the EDC ’ s rejection .
Back in the 1950 ’ s , the founding nations ’ foreign ministers promptly turned to their Belgian colleague , Paul ##AT##-##AT## Henri Spaak , for fresh proposals .
After intensive discussion among the six , and especially between France and Germany , the Treaty of Rome was drawn up and signed within two years of the EDC debacle .
By contrast , two years after the French and Dutch No votes , there is no sign of a Plan B , despite the claims of the French politicians who helped mobilize the No vote . Europe ’ s Franco ##AT##-##AT## German locomotive has broken down and ratification has stopped , even though member states that had yet to ratify the treaty could have completed the process of ratification .
France ’ s loss of influence in Europe is no longer at stake today , because the notion of influence presupposes that the overriding preoccupation of EU member states is to advance their own national interests .
If Europe were only about gaining the upper hand , it would generate perpetual conflict .
The reality is that Europe does manage to move ahead , but step by step through mutual compromise .
The real question has more to do with France ’ s credibility and its capacity to remain a driving force in Europe .
A journalist recently expressed the view that France ’ s special role in Europe was due to its “ centrality , ” meaning that the French are , in equal measure , both open to the world and attached to their nation . They also participate successfully in a market economy while seeking to preserve an egalitarian social model .
The No vote sullied this image of a balanced France .
Indeed , the French themselves are among the first to lament their bleak situation , inventing a new concept – “ la déclinologie ” – to describe this loss of self – confidence .
Moreover , the No vote has given a new legitimacy to euro ##AT##-##AT## skepticism in other member states .
To be sure , the rise of populism in Europe was not caused by the French ; nationalism is deeply rooted in Europe ’ s history and has many causes .
But France ’ s referendum result fueled other European governments ’ fears that any new proposal they might put forward to re ##AT##-##AT## launch the EU constitution would fail in the face of domestic and Europe ##AT##-##AT## wide opposition .
But reducing European aspirations to the goals of Realpolitik is no answer to today ’ s crisis .
Europeans need to recognize that strength lies in unity , and that Europe ’ s integration cannot be guaranteed without a common constitutional framework that promotes a common identity .
Until we think in terms of European sovereignty , rather than fret over risks to national sovereignty , the present crisis cannot be overcome .
KERALA , INDIA – Beginning this month , the largest exercise of the democratic franchise in history will take place , as India n voters head to the polls to elect a new national parliament . They have done this 14 times since India gained its independence .
Each time India has voted has been the world ’ s largest exercise in electoral democracy . India ’ s growing population keeps breaking its own record .
This time , the electorate includes 714 million voters , an increase of 43 million over the previous general election in 2004 .
Votes will be cast in 828,804 polling stations scattered throughout the country for over 5000 candidates from seven national political parties and several state and other parties .
The process involves four million electoral officials and 6.1 million police and civilian personnel .
The numbers involved are so huge that the elections will be staggered over five phases , ending only on May 13 , with electoral and security personnel being moved from state to state as polling is concluded in each place .
Despite the phased voting , the counting takes place nationwide immediately after the last phase , and the results of the elections everywhere will be announced on May 16 .
A new parliament will be convened on June 2 to elect a national government to succeed the outgoing administration of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
India ’ s elections , conducted by the autonomous ( and all ##AT##-##AT## powerful ) Election Commission of India , are an extraordinary event , and not just because of their sheer scale .
It takes the felling of a sizeable forest to furnish enough paper for 714 million ballots , and every election has at least one story of officers battling through snow or jungle , or traveling by elephant and camel , to ensure that the democratic wishes of remote constituents are duly recorded .
( There is even one polling booth for a single voter , who lives too far from civilization to travel to another polling station . )
Nor is any Indian election complete without the media publishing at least one picture of a female voter whose enthusiasm for the suffrage is undimmed by the fact that she is old , blind , crippled , toothless , purdah ##AT##-##AT## clad , or any combination of the above .
The exotica do not end there .
Because so many voters are illiterate , India invented the party symbol , so that voters who cannot read the name of their candidate can vote for him or her anyway by recognizing the symbol under which they campaigned .
Symbols range from the open palm of the ruling Indian National Congress to the lotus of the Bharatiya Janata Party and variants of the hammer and sickle for India ’ s profusion of Communist parties .
Independent candidates can choose from an assortment of alternatives , ranging from a cricket bat to images of various large animals .
( Small ones were removed from the list when one candidate , running against another whose symbol was a parrot , wrung the neck of a live parrot at a public meeting to signify what he would do to his rival . )
India was also the first country to use an indelible stain on the voter ’ s fingernail to signify that he has already cast his ballot .
At every election , someone “ discovers ” a new chemical that will remove the stain and permit one to vote twice , though this is unlikely to make a great difference in constituencies the size of India ’ s , where each MP represents more than two million people .
Likewise , some distinguished voter invariably claims that his name is missing from the rolls , or that someone has already cast his vote ( but usually not both ) .
In any case , India ’ s elections have a reputation for honesty .
In this election , as in previous ones , votes will be cast on electronic voting machines invented in India , which combine the virtues of simplicity , reliability , and ruggedness .
The electoral rolls carry photographs of every individual voter , as does each voter ’ s identity card .
The elections have also been increasingly free of violence .
There was a time when , in certain parts of India , workers could stuff ballot boxes for a candidate and political parties could “ capture ” polling booths .
Electronic voting machines and strict security arrangements have largely eliminated that possibility .
It has been some time since there were reports of the occasional election worker , candidate , or voter being assaulted , kidnapped , or shot .
Nothing ( short of the death of a major contender ) interrupts the franchise .
Elections are an enduring spectacle of free India , and give foreign journalists the opportunity to remind the world that India is the world ’ s largest democracy .
Indeed , Indians now take for granted that elections will take place , that they will be free and fair , and that they will result in actual transfers of power .
There are few developing countries in the world where this is true , and fewer still where poverty and illiteracy are both rife .
That may be the real miracle of what will occur in India over the next few weeks .
While the internet boom lasted , nothing seemed able to deflate the bubble .
Few internet and dot com companies were profitable , but investors never seemed to mind .
They looked at the number of customers or subscribers as the basis for valuing internet stocks .
The name of the game became raising capital , not making profits .
Even when fashionable stocks dipped , there was remarkably little effect on the rest of the market .
People had learned that it pays to buy the dips , and were not weaned from the habit until it ceased to pay .
Now that internet fever has abated , we hear that the “ fundamentals ” are reasserting themselves .
But this view is as much a half ##AT##-##AT## truth as the previous notion that the boom would last forever because the internet economy had created new fundamentals .
Indeed , the internet boom / bust cycle brings into question prevailing economic theories about financial markets .
What should now be clear is that the so ##AT##-##AT## called fundamentals that supposedly determine stock prices are not independently given .
Instead , they are contingent on the behavior of financial markets .
There are , indeed , myriad ways in which stock prices affect the fortunes of companies : they determine the cost of equity capital ; they decide whether a company will be taken over or acquire other companies ; stock prices influence a company ’ s capacity to borrow and its ability to attract and reward management through stock options ; stock prices serve as an advertising and marketing tool .
In other words , when financial markets believe a company is doing well , its “ fundamentals ” improve ; when markets change their mind , the actual fortunes of the company change with them .
Moreover , changes in financial markets also have far reaching macroeconomic consequences .
It did not take a genius to realize that the internet boom , based not on profit expectations but on the expectations of selling stock to the public at ever increasing prices , rested on an unsustainable business model .
It also did not take a genius to see that boom would be followed by bust , but it was harder to guess when that bust would occur .
In the summer of 1999 I was convinced that an internet crash was imminent .
Yet internet stocks recovered from a short dip ; some soon rose to new highs .
Institutions that live and die by relative performance felt obliged to increase their internet holdings .
When Yahoo was included in the S &amp; P 500 Index , it jumped 30 % in a day .
People like me who had sold internet stocks short in the belief that a crash was imminent were forced to cover them at whopping losses .
I remained convinced that a bust was bound to come , but I could not afford to stand by my convictions .
Despite its irrational aspects , the internet boom was more than a matter of inflated valuations .
The optimism of the financial markets not only changed the “ fundamentals ” of individual businesses , it had real and profound effects throughout the whole economy .
The boom did not only follow from the development of the internet ; it accelerated that development and contributed to the speed and extension of technological innovation .
The same was true in telecommunications , where the boom also accelerated the spread of new technology .
The internet bust , when it finally came , was caused not by an unsound business model , but by over ##AT##-##AT## extension of credit .
The present slowdown is affecting the fundamentals of individual companies almost as much as their stock prices ; it also affects the financial system and macroeconomic performance .
Instead of a one ##AT##-##AT## way connection in which financial markets discount the future more or less accurately , there exists a two ##AT##-##AT## way connection in which financial markets shape the future they are supposed to discount .
Instead of a single outcome , there is a range of possibilities .
Which of those possibilities materializes depends not only on the future evolution of the so ##AT##-##AT## called fundamentals but on financial market behavior as well .
In these circumstances , it is irrational for market participants to base their decisions solely on their expectations about fundamentals because the fundamentals do not determine market prices ; on the contrary , they are shaped by market conditions .
So what matters to market participants is the future course of market prices , not the fundamentals they are said to reflect .
If market prices deviate from a theoretical equilibrium there can be no assurance that they will ever return to it .
This is why the recent boom / bust sequence in internet and telecommunication stocks is so revealing .
These developments cannot be explained in terms of efficient markets and rational expectations .
I have proposed an alternative explanation based on the two ##AT##-##AT## way connection between fundamentals and valuations which I call “ reflexivity ” .
I am amazed and amused that economists ignore my arguments .
They claim that the phenomenon of reflexivity is already taken into account in the concept of multiple equilibria which has gained acceptance recently .
Maybe so , but I have yet to see how persistent movements away from a theoretical equilibrium can be explained within the framework of multiple equilibria .
Any divergence from equilibrium , whether one assumes that there is a unique equilibrium or many equilibria , amounts to more than noise ; it is a causal factor in determining the very nature of the “ equilibrium ” that will prevail .
By ignoring this condition , efficient market theory presents a totally misleading picture of financial markets .
Why is my reasoning dismissed out of hand ?
Because it leads to the conclusion that financial markets are inherently unpredictable .
What is the value of a scientific theory , I am asked , if it does not yield useable predictions ?
I contend that it would be better to recognize the uncertainties inherent in the behavior of financial markets than to cling to a supposedly scientific theory that distorts reality .
One consequence of the realization that financial markets are potentially unstable , is a recognition of the need for financial authorities to make it their business to prevent excesses .
The debate about efficient markets may be arcane , but the consequences for our lives are very real indeed .
BRISBANE – What will happen if Californians votes this November to legalize marijuana use by any adult over the age of 21 years ?
Let ’ s ignore for the moment the vexed constitutional issues that will be raised if a US state enacts legislation that conflicts with federal law .
Let ’ s focus instead on what may happen if the law changes as the referendum proposes .
If we are to believe the referendum ’ s supporters , all Californians will be winners .
The change will legitimize marijuana ’ s de facto legal status since passage of Proposition 215 in 1996 .
It will thus reduce state expenditure on enforcing a widely violated law ; remove marijuana growing and selling from the black market ; enable any adult who wishes to use marijuana to do so ; and introduce a tax on legal marijuana sales that will fill state coffers with revenue that formerly went to illegal growers ( so long as there is no large ##AT##-##AT## scale tax evasion ) .
By contrast , opponents predict that the change will increase rates of marijuana use , and thus magnify the harm arising from that use .
The adverse consequences of greatest concern include more marijuana ##AT##-##AT## related road traffic accidents and deaths ; more psychoses and other serious mental health problems among heavy users ; and heavier marijuana use by young people , negatively affecting their life chances .
These effects , they argue , will more than offset any gains from tax revenue and savings from law enforcement .
It is difficult to know who is right , because no other country has adopted this policy .
The Netherlands , which is popularly believed to have legalized cannabis use along these lines , has in fact tolerated only small ##AT##-##AT## scale retail sales of marijuana in a limited number of coffee shops in its larger cities .
Marijuana cultivation remains illegal and coffee shop sales are regulated – more strictly in recent years in response to complaints from neighboring countries about “ drug tourism . ”
Nevertheless , some broad predictions can be made .
First , openly tolerating a market in a previously illegal commodity will expand the number of users , especially if the retail price is lower than the black ##AT##-##AT## market price ( as is proposed in the Ammiano Bill currently before the California legislature ) .
Use may not increase immediately , but it will over time , because marijuana will become more freely available , much cheaper ( in order to discourage the persistence of a black market ) , and its use will be implicitly condoned .
Experience with alcohol suggests that marijuana will be available to underage users ( as it is now ) , whatever the minimum legal age .
Thus , legally available cheaper marijuana will probably mean more use by more young people , and probably more daily use later into adulthood . In general , the more people who use a drug , the larger the number of problem users there will be ( on the reasonable assumption that problem users comprise a fixed proportion of all users ) .
If current estimates are correct , around 10 % of users ( and one in six who start in adolescence ) may become dependent on marijuana – that is , find it difficult to control or discontinue their use .
A minority of these problem users will seek professional help to quit .
Dependent marijuana users are more likely to experience road and workplace accidents ( if they drive or work while intoxicated ) ; increased respiratory disease ( if they smoke marijuana ) ; exacerbations of some serious mental disorders ; and impaired school and work performance .
It is uncertain how far these adverse effects can be mitigated by preventive measures such as implementing roadside drug ##AT##-##AT## testing programs , persuading users to use vaporizers rather than smoke joints , discouraging young people from using marijuana , and encouraging early treatment for problem users .
Experience with alcohol suggests that these approaches may modestly reduce , but not eliminate , the harms associated with use , especially if sellers are allowed to promote their wares .
Indeed , the scale of any increase in marijuana use will critically depend on how tightly regulated marijuana sales are – how many licensed growers there are , the number of sales outlets , their locations and trading hours , eligibility requirements for use , content of THC ( marijuana ’ s psychoactive ingredient ) , and how much promotion and advertising is allowed .
If marijuana were allowed to be marketed much like alcohol is now , we could expect more problem users than if it were regulated more like pharmaceutical drugs ( say , by requiring users to be licensed ; restricting the number of sales locations , hours of sale , and licensed growers ; and imposing high rates of taxation on higher ##AT##-##AT## THC marijuana ) .
It will be a major policy challenge to get this balance right .
Greater restrictions would provide incentives for illegal operators to remain , while less restrictive regulation would discourage black marketeers , but at the price of increasing the number of users and problem users . &amp; # 160 ;
Marijuana policy involves a choice between the evils of current repressive policies and the evils of increased use under a legal market .
Californians will have to decide how much weight to give to respect for adult liberty , protection of minors , avoidance of a large ##AT##-##AT## scale black market , fiscal considerations , and protection of marijuana users ’ health .
If they vote for legalization , it will probably be 20 years or more before anyone can say whether , on balance , they decided wisely .
PRINCETON – When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan in March , Brian Tucker was in Padang , Indonesia .
Tucker was working with a colleague to design a refuge that could save thousands of lives if – or rather , when – a tsunami like the one in 1797 that came out of the Indian Ocean , some 600 miles southeast of where the 2004 Asian tsunami originated , strikes again .
Tucker is the founder and president of GeoHazards International , a nonprofit organization whose mission is to reduce death and suffering due to earthquakes in the world ’ s most vulnerable communities .
Padang is one of those communities .
Just to its northwest , in Banda Aceh , 160,000 lives were lost in the 2004 tsunami .
Now , geologists say , the fault that triggered that tsunami is most likely to rupture farther south , putting low ##AT##-##AT## lying coastal towns like Padang , with a population of 900,000 , at high risk of a major earthquake and tsunami within the next 30 years .
In Banda Aceh , the tsunami killed more than half the city ’ s population .
In Padang , according to an estimate by the director of the city ’ s disaster management office , a similar tsunami could kill more than 400,000 people .
Tucker says that he has stood on the beach in Padang , looking out at the ocean and trying to imagine what it would be like to see a five ##AT##-##AT## meter ##AT##-##AT## high wall of water stretching across the horizon , bearing down on the city .
Now that we have seen the footage of the tsunami that hit Japan , the demands on our imagination have been lessened – except that we have to imagine away the sea walls that Japan had built to reduce the impact of the tsunami .
True , those walls did not work as well as had been hoped , but Japan was nonetheless much better prepared for a tsunami than Padang is .
In Padang , even with advance warning of a tsunami , higher ground is too far away , and the narrow streets too choked with traffic , for many people to get to safety in time .
GeoHazards International is therefore working on a more practical idea , which it calls a Tsunami Evacuation Raised Earth Park ( TEREP ) .
The idea is to build small hills in low ##AT##-##AT## lying parts of the city , with level tops that could be used as parks or sports fields .
With the few minutes ’ warning that an earthquake ’ s strong shaking would automatically provide , people could walk to a TEREP and be safe above the highest level a tsunami could reach .
Such raised earth parks are a low ##AT##-##AT## cost solution to the tsunami danger in low ##AT##-##AT## lying coastal areas .
They use only local materials , provide a valuable community resource in normal times , and have the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives when a tsunami strikes .
Nevertheless , GeoHazards International lacks the resources to build anything like enough TEREPs to meet the need .
After 20 years of operation , the organization remains tiny , especially when compared to organizations like the Red Cross , which primarily do disaster relief work .
People are willing to donate hundreds of millions of dollars to help people after a disaster – even after a disaster in a wealthy country like Japan – but are unwilling to invest anything like the same amount to save lives before a predictable disaster strikes .
One reason for this is that preventing a disaster does not make good television .
People give to identifiable victims .
If we build raised earth parks , we will never see the people who , but for our aid , would have died ; no orphans in desperate need will appear on the nightly news .
But isn ’ t it much better to keep parents safe than to help orphans after their parents have been killed ?
This is a situation in which we must stretch our imagination , to understand and be motivated by the good that we are doing .
Unfortunately , not everyone can do that .
Another reason why we do not give to prevent disasters should be familiar to anyone who has ever delayed going to the dentist because the prospect of serious pain in the coming weeks or months just wasn ’ t as motivating as the reluctance to face some more immediate slight discomfort .
We tell ourselves that maybe we won ’ t get a toothache after all , even though we know that the odds are that we will .
Most of us are not very good at giving proper weight to future events , especially if they are uncertain .
So we may tell ourselves that the geologists could be wrong , and perhaps no tsunami will hit Padang in the next 30 years , and by then perhaps we will have new and better technologies for predicting them , giving people more time to get to higher ground .
Instead , we should be guided by the best estimates of the chances that an intervention will save lives , as well as by the number of lives that would be saved , and the cost of saving those lives .
The evidence suggests that building raised earth parks in places like Padang is very good value indeed .
STANFORD – During the late 1990 ’ s , a singular phenomenon appeared in countries around the world .
One after another , food and beverage companies capitulated to activists opposed to a promising new technology : the genetic engineering of plants to produce ingredients .
They are still capitulating to this day .
The Japanese brewer Kirin and the Danish brewer Carlsberg eliminated genetically engineered ingredients from their beers .
In the United States , the fast ##AT##-##AT## food giant McDonald &apos;s banned them from its menu ; food manufacturers Heinz and Gerber ( then a division of Switzerland ##AT##-##AT## based Novartis ) dropped them from their baby ##AT##-##AT## food lines ; and Frito ##AT##-##AT## Lay demanded that its growers stop planting corn engineered to contain a bacterial protein that confers resistance to insect predation .
These measures were rationalized in various ways , but the reality is that by yielding to the demands of a minuscule number of disingenuous activists , the companies opted to offer less safe products to consumers , thereby exposing themselves to legal jeopardy .
Every year , innumerable packaged ##AT##-##AT## food products worldwide are withheld or recalled from the market due to the presence of “ all natural ” contaminants like insect parts , toxic molds , bacteria , and viruses .
Because farming takes place outdoors and in dirt , such contamination is a fact of life .
Over the centuries , the main culprit in mass food poisoning often has been contamination of unprocessed crops by fungal toxins – a risk that is exacerbated when insects attack food crops , opening wounds that allow fungi ( molds ) to get a foothold .
For example , fumonisin and some other fungal toxins are highly toxic , causing esophageal cancer in humans and fatal diseases in livestock that eat infected corn .
Fumonisin also interferes with the cellular uptake of folic acid , a vitamin that reduces the risk of neural tube defects in developing fetuses , and thus can cause folic acid deficiency – and defects such as spina bifida – even when one ’ s diet contains what otherwise would be sufficient amounts of the vitamin .
Many regulatory agencies have therefore established recommended maximum fumonisin levels permitted in food and feed products made from corn .
The conventional way to meet those standards and prevent the consumption of fungal toxins is simply to test unprocessed and processed grains and discard those found to be contaminated – an approach that is both wasteful and failure ##AT##-##AT## prone .
But modern technology – specifically , the genetic engineering of plants using recombinant DNA technology ( also known as food biotechnology or genetic modification ) – offers a way to prevent the problem .
Contrary to the claims of food ##AT##-##AT## biotech critics , who insist that genetically modified crops pose risks ( none of which has actually occurred ) of new allergens or toxins in the food supply , such products offer the food industry a proven and practical means of tackling the fungal contamination at its source .
An excellent example is corn that is crafted by splicing into commercial varieties a gene ( or genes ) from a harmless bacterium .
The bacterial genes express proteins that are toxic to corn ##AT##-##AT## boring insects , but that are harmless to birds , fish , and mammals , including humans .
As the modified corn fends off insect pests , it also reduces the levels of the mold Fusarium , thereby reducing the levels of fumonisin .
Indeed , researchers at Iowa State University and the US Department of Agriculture have found that the level of fumonisin in the modified corn is reduced by as much as 80 % compared to conventional corn .
Similarly , an Italian study of weaned piglets that were fed either conventional corn or the same variety modified to synthesize a bacterial protein that confers resistance to insect predation found that the modified variety contained lower levels of fumonisin .
More importantly , the piglets that consumed the modified corn achieved a greater final weight , a measure of overall health , despite no difference in feed intake between the two groups .
Given the health benefits – to say nothing of the often higher and more reliable yields – governments should introduce incentives aimed at increasing use of such genetically engineered grains and other crops .
In addition , one would expect public ##AT##-##AT## health advocates to demand that such improved varieties be cultivated and used for food , not unlike requirements that drinking water be chlorinated and fluoridated .
And food producers that are committed to offering the safest and best products to their customers should be competing to get genetically engineered products into the marketplace .
Alas , none of this has come to pass .
Activists continue to mount vocal and tenacious opposition to genetically engineered foods , despite almost 20 years of demonstrated , significant benefits , including reduced use of chemical pesticides ( and thus less chemical runoff into waterways ) , greater use of farming practices that prevent soil erosion , higher profits for farmers , and less fungal contamination .
Responding to the bleating of activists , policymakers have subjected the testing and commercialization of genetically engineered crops to unscientific and draconian regulations , with dire consequences .
A groundbreaking study of the political economy of agricultural biotechnology concluded that over ##AT##-##AT## regulation causes “ delays in the global diffusion of proven technologies , resulting in a lower rate of growth in the global food supply and higher food prices . ”
Current policies also create “ disincentives for investing in further research and development , resulting in a slowdown in innovation of second ##AT##-##AT## generation technologies anticipated to introduce broad consumer and environmental benefits . ”
Everyone involved in food production and consumption has suffered : consumers ( especially in developing countries ) have been subjected to avoidable health risks , and food producers have placed themselves in legal jeopardy for selling products known to have “ design defects . ”
Public policy that discriminates against and discourages vital innovations in food production is not policy that has the public ’ s interest at heart .
Thirty years ago America &apos;s president declared &quot; war on cancer &quot; .
This year , in the US alone , 1,500 men , women and children lose their personal battle with cancer every day .
When will the war end ?
I believe that for many cancers the war will end soon .
Thanks to knowledge from basic research , we have new tools with which to attack cancer .
These new tools are providing more rapid diagnosis and more effective treatments .
They are producing new drugs that target molecular changes unique to cancer cells , making it possible to predict who may be at risk for developing cancer because of genetic or environmental factors .
These advances will save many lives .
Cancer affects many different organs and tissues in the body .
Although cancers differ greatly in their appearance and behavior , they have a common cause : damage to genes .
Genes are chemical coding units that specify the structure and function of our bodies .
All the cells in our bodies have the same complement of genes , half from each of our parents .
What makes one kind of cell different from another is the combination of genes that are active in each cell .
Genes can be damaged by environmental factors , such as radiation or chemicals .
They can also be damaged by the products of normal metabolism .
Our bodies have elaborate repair systems that maintain the integrity of our genes , even in the presence of damaging agents .
Occasionally , however , damage is not repaired .
If the damage occurs in key genes that regulate cell growth , cancer can develop .
The repair systems themselves help protect us from cancer .
For example , one kind of colon cancer develops more frequently in individuals who have a defect in a system that repairs damaged genes .
Cell growth is regulated by a balance between genes that stimulate growth , and those that inhibit it .
Genes that stimulate cell growth are called oncogenes ; those that inhibit it are called tumor suppressor genes .
When oncogenes are activated , or tumor suppressor genes disabled , cells can multiply out of control .
Oncogenes can be activated by mutation ( changes in gene structure ) or by gene amplification ( production of many copies of a gene ) .
Tumor suppressor genes can be disabled by mutation , or by spontaneous loss during cell division .
Cancer cells are genetically unstable , that is , they have abnormal numbers of chromosomes , the cellular elements that carry genes .
Genetic instability contributes to loss of growth control by producing imbalances in gene activity .
Traditionally cancer has been diagnosed by the characteristic appearance of cancer cells observed through a microscope .
Increasingly , cancers are identified by their characteristic patterns of gene activity ( their &quot; molecular signature &quot; ) .
New techniques , including &quot; gene chips &quot; , have made it possible to measure the activity of thousands of genes simultaneously .
The molecular signatures can be used to classify cancers more precisely , making them easier to treat .
For example , these techniques have been used to identify some kinds of lymphomas ( cancers of the blood ) that respond well to chemotherapy .
Similar techniques have been used to identify genes involved in tumor metastasis .
Some genetic changes are common to many types of cancer , whereas other changes are specific to particular cancers .
Dozens of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been identified , providing targets for the development of new anti ##AT##-##AT## cancer drugs .
A striking recent example is a drug that targets a molecular change characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells .
The drug is providing an alternative to bone marrow transplantation , the only treatment that was effective previously .
Mutations in certain genes have been found to cause hereditary forms of breast and ovarian cancer .
This has made it possible to identify women who may be at high risk because they inherit these susceptibility genes .
( Inherited forms of breast and ovarian cancer are only a small fraction of the total . )
Close observation and rapid treatment , or prophylactic surgery , can reduce the risk of these inherited forms of cancer .
Advances in imaging techniques are making it possible to detect cancer earlier , which can help eliminate tumors before they become life ##AT##-##AT## threatening .
New imaging techniques are also helping to guide surgery , so that tumors can be removed more precisely .
Other leads are emerging from a better understanding of how tumors grow .
Tumors need a plentiful blood supply , so they produce factors that induce the formation of blood vessels ( a process called angiogenesis ) .
New drugs , which have been designed to inhibit tumor angiogenesis , are showing promise in clinical trials .
It is estimated that 10 ##AT##-##AT## 15 % of cancer worldwide is associated with viral infection .
Liver cancer , which is associated with hepatitis , and cervical cancer , associated with human papilloma virus infection , are prominent examples .
A vaccine against hepatitis B virus is proving to be effective in reducing the incidence of liver cancer .
Rapid and specific diagnostic tests for the human papilloma virus are supplementing traditional Pap tests , helping to identify women at risk for cervical cancer .
One of the most intriguing discoveries of modern biology is that cell death is intimately involved with growth and development .
For example , nerve cells are produced in excess , and some die in order for proper connections to be established in the nervous system .
Cells contain a &quot; suicide program &quot; that is activated when the cells are damaged beyond repair .
Intriguingly , cancer cells respond abnormally to death signals .
Some of the genes involved in the suicide program are the same genes that are altered in cancer cells .
A promising approach now being explored for treating cancer is to activate the suicide program of cancer cells without disturbing normal cells .
Although the future cannot be predicted with assurance , it seems reasonable to expect that the burden of cancer will be reduced substantially in the next ten years by new treatments .
For some cancers , like liver cancer and chronic myelogenous leukemia mentioned , this is already happening .
For other cancers , the means for prevention are at hand , but the application is problematical , as in the case of lung cancer caused by cigarette smoking .
It is unlikely that most cancers will disappear in the near future ; rather they will be diagnosed more precisely and treated more effectively , thereby increasing the number of people who can be cured .
MUNICH – Would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge ?
A challenging new book by the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker says that the answer is “ yes . ”
In The Better Angels of Our Nature , Pinker presents data showing that human violence , while still very much with us today , has been gradually declining .
Moreover , he says , “ over the long sweep of history , women have been and will be a pacifying force .
Traditional war is a man ’ s game : tribal women never band together to raid neighboring villages . ”
As mothers , women have evolutionary incentives to maintain peaceful conditions in which to nurture their offspring and ensure that their genes survive into the next generation .
Skeptics immediately reply that women have not made war simply because they have rarely been in power .
If they were empowered as leaders , the conditions of an anarchic world would force them to make the same bellicose decisions that men do .
Margaret Thatcher , Golda Meir , and Indira Gandhi were powerful women ; all of them led their countries to war .
But it is also true that these women rose to leadership by playing according to the political rules of “ a man ’ s world . ”
It was their success in conforming to male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place .
In a world in which women held a proportionate share ( one ##AT##-##AT## half ) of leadership positions , they might behave differently in power .
So we are left with the broader question : does gender really matter in leadership ?
In terms of stereotypes , various psychological studies show that men gravitate to the hard power of command , while women are collaborative and intuitively understand the soft power of attraction and persuasion .
Americans tend to describe leadership with tough male stereotypes , but recent leadership studies show increased success for what was once considered a “ feminine style . ”
In information ##AT##-##AT## based societies , networks are replacing hierarchies , and knowledge workers are less deferential .
Management in a wide range of organizations is changing in the direction of “ shared leadership , ” and “ distributed leadership , ” with leaders in the center of a circle rather than atop a pyramid .
Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said that he had to “ coddle ” his employees .
Even the military faces these changes .
In the United States , the Pentagon says that Army drillmasters do “ less shouting at everyone , ” because today ’ s generation responds better to instructors who play “ a more counseling ##AT##-##AT## type role . ”
Military success against terrorists and counterinsurgents requires soldiers to win hearts and minds , not just break buildings and bodies .
Former US President George W. Bush once described his role as “ the decider , ” but there is much more to modern leadership than that .
Modern leaders must be able to use networks , to collaborate , and to encourage participation .
Women ’ s non ##AT##-##AT## hierarchical style and relational skills fit a leadership need in the new world of knowledge ##AT##-##AT## based organizations and groups that men , on average , are less well prepared to meet .
In the past , when women fought their way to the top of organizations , they often had to adopt a “ masculine style , ” violating the broader social norm of female “ niceness . ”
Now , however , with the information revolution and democratization demanding more participatory leadership , the “ feminine style ” is becoming a path to more effective leadership .
In order to lead successfully , men will not only have to value this style in their women colleagues , but will also have to master the same skills .
That is a trend , not ( yet ) a fact .
Women still lag in leadership positions , holding only 5 % of top corporate positions and a minority of positions in elected legislatures ( just 16 % in the US , for example , compared to 45 % in Sweden ) .
One study of the 1,941 rulers of independent countries during the twentieth century found only 27 women , roughly half of whom came to power as widows or daughters of a male ruler .
Less than 1 % of twentieth ##AT##-##AT## century rulers were women who gained power on their own .
So , given the new conventional wisdom in leadership studies that entering the information age means entering a woman ’ s world , why are women not doing better ?
Lack of experience , primary caregiver responsibilities , bargaining style , and plain old discrimination all help to explain the gender gap .
Traditional career paths , and the cultural norms that constructed and reinforced them , simply have not enabled women to gain the skills required for top leadership positions in many organizational contexts .
Research shows that even in democratic societies , women face a higher social risk than men when attempting to negotiate for career ##AT##-##AT## related resources such as compensation .
Women are generally not well integrated into male networks that dominate organizations , and gender stereotypes still hamper women who try to overcome such barriers .
This bias is beginning to break down in information ##AT##-##AT## based societies , but it is a mistake to identify the new type of leadership we need in an information age simply as “ a woman ’ s world . ”
Even positive stereotypes are bad for women , men , and effective leadership .
Leaders should be viewed less in terms of heroic command than as encouraging participation throughout an organization , group , country , or network .
Questions of appropriate style – when to use hard and soft skills – are equally relevant for men and women , and should not be clouded by traditional gender stereotypes .
In some circumstances , men will need to act more “ like women ” ; in others , women will need to be more “ like men . ”
The key choices about war and peace in our future will depend not on gender , but on how leaders combine hard- and soft ##AT##-##AT## power skills to produce smart strategies .
Both men and women will make those decisions .
But Pinker is probably correct when he notes that the parts of the world that lag in the decline of violence are also the parts that lag in the empowerment of women .
Most commentators routinely assume that a Yes vote in the May 29 French referendum on the proposed European Union Constitution would be good for Europe and the EU .
But there is reason to doubt the conventional wisdom .
The French referendum will determine the political fate of French President Jacques Chirac – not France ’ s commitment to Europe , which is fixed and immutable .
If the French vote No , M. Chirac is finished .
If they vote Yes , he is re ##AT##-##AT## empowered .
Europe clearly would be better off with Chirac weakened than strengthened , even if it means a temporary slowing of the pace of integration .
Chirac practices the politics of “ scapegoatism ” and excuses .
According to Chirac , France ’ s exports are lagging not because France is losing its international competitiveness – although it is , especially to Germany – but because of the strong euro .
Likewise , France ’ s economic growth is waning not because France has failed to undertake necessary structural reforms , but because European interest rates are too high .
Who does Chirac think is at fault ?
The European Central Bank , of course , for allowing the euro to appreciate too much and for not cutting interest rates enough .
Unfortunately , this is typical of Chirac ’ s leadership style : blame others , excuse yourself , and ignore reform .
This is hardly the type of leadership Europe needs to survive and prosper in the modern world .
But Europe will get more of it if the French vote Yes .
Europe also would continue to be dominated by the interests of the big countries , with the small countries in the back of the bus .
The fate of the Franco ##AT##-##AT## German axis , in particular , hinges on the outcome of the referendum .
A Yes invigorates the axis ; a No weakens it .
“ Who would follow Chirac if the French vote No ? ” asked one EU ambassador in a recent interview . “ Even Berlin has options . ”
If Chirac goes down , German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder loses face as well . Two birds would be wounded with one stone .
The prospect of a re ##AT##-##AT## energized Franco ##AT##-##AT## German axis is why the Dutch – who are traditionally pro ##AT##-##AT## European but do not want a Europe that marginalizes small countries – might vote No in their referendum ( which follows shortly upon France ’ s ) if the French vote Yes .
A Dutch No would signal rejection of a corporatist Europe dominated by French and German interests , as well as representing a protest against the unpopular conservative and moralistic policies of the Balkenende government .
France is not the only EU country with an unpopular leader .
Eastern Europe also has a big stake in the outcome of the French referendum .
Chirac made it perfectly clear how he feels about the new smaller countries when he told them to “ shut up ” when they disagreed with him over Iraq .
More recently , Chirac ’ s foreign minister , Michel Barnier , chastised the Romanian President Traian Barescu for lacking a “ European reflex , ” because Barescu plans to align Romania with Anglo ##AT##-##AT## Saxon liberal economic policies , and wants a special relationship with the US and UK to improve security in the Black Sea region .
Rather than buckle to France ’ s will , however , the Romanian president warned France ’ s leaders to stop lecturing his country – a sure sign that French influence is on the wane even in countries with which it has had close historical ties .
A French No would sit well with the Union ’ s newer members from Eastern Europe , who know Chirac is not their friend , and who are more attracted by promises of rapid economic growth than social protection and corporate state mischief .
Finally , the referendum contains an unstated question about the future of European Monetary Union ( EMU ) and the euro .
The Yes camp argues that rejecting the Constitution would damage the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the euro .
But why would the EU fall into chaos and the euro wilt if the Treaty of Nice remains in force .
In the area of monetary integration , the European Constitution doesn ’ t change anything , other than the voting procedures in the Governing Council if EMU grows beyond 15 member countries .
A Yes vote , on the other hand , would encourage a reassured Chirac to continue his policy of no reform and scapegoating the ECB .
External political pressure on the ECB and its president , Jean ##AT##-##AT## Claude Trichet , to lower interest rates and talk the euro down surely would increase .
This is more likely to bring the euro down than a No vote .
The European Union has been so successful that you would have thought there would be dancing in the streets at its 50th anniversary .
Alas , there has been only persistent talk of failure – to achieve political union , to adopt a constitution , to exercise global leadership and vision , to implement economic reforms , and the list of laments goes on . “ The EU is on autopilot , in stalemate , in deep crisis , ” claims Joschka Fischer , the former German foreign minister and an important voice in Europe .
But this angst and hand ##AT##-##AT## wringing simply is not convincing .
Consider Germany .
After World War II , it was a beaten and devastated nation with a history of dysfunctional nationalism . Today , a totally rehabilitated Germany is as thoroughly European and democratic as any other EU nation – indeed , under the leadership of Angela Merkel , Germany has earned its place as Europe ’ s most important country .
The EU deserves great credit for this transformation .
After the War , it was a prime EU objective to moderate nationalism and promote regionalism in Germany , a feat that was accomplished to the benefit of all Europeans .
Shouldn ’ t they – and others – be celebrating this major success instead of becoming bogged down in defeatist talk of crisis and stalemate ?
Besides , where is the alleged crisis and stalemate ?
On the economic front , the euro ##AT##-##AT## zone economy performed extremely well in 2006 , and most experts predict that economic growth in 2007 will be faster in Europe than in the United States , notwithstanding Germany ’ s hefty increase in value ##AT##-##AT## added tax .
Even more impressive , the lack of full political union in Europe has not stalemated the EU ’ s adoption of the euro and the common monetary policy .
On the contrary , the quick international acceptance of the euro as one of the world ’ s premier currencies , aided by the European Central Bank ’ s determination to keep inflation under control , indicates that the monetary project is going full steam ahead .
Currently , the euro is strengthening against the US dollar , because central banks in Asia and the Middle East are increasing the euro component of their foreign exchange reserves – a clear vote of confidence in the new currency and the ECB .
Both the success of the euro and the smooth functioning of the common monetary policy show that important “ European ” projects can be accomplished even without the benefit of full political union .
While the EU ’ s member states have proved themselves capable of putting aside their differences when forging a common monetary policy , a common foreign policy has proved more elusive .
On issues like the Iraq war and American plans to install missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic , Europeans appear to find it difficult to speak with a single voice .
The reason is clear : Europe remains too dependent on the US for its defense needs .
Some EU members ( Germany and Italy ) are more dependent on the US than others ( France ) , and thus more likely to support US strategic initiatives .
So long as these differences remain , so will Europe ’ s political divisions .
But defense independence vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis US implies a vast re ##AT##-##AT## allocation of resources from social welfare programs to the military , which so far has not interested the Europeans .
Rather than reflecting a lack of political will to come together and speak with a single voice on strategic issues – the conventional interpretation – diverse voices are the result of an implicit choice that Europeans make .
Many Europeans have decided that it is better to keep their robust social welfare programs and forgo a common foreign and defense policy , which would require massive changes in the European way of life .
Moreover , with the disappearance of the Soviet Union as a common threat , Europe ’ s left ##AT##-##AT## wing parties are increasingly defining themselves as anti ##AT##-##AT## American .
Thus , when José Zapatero and the Socialists took control of Spain ’ s government from the conservatives , the country ’ s foreign policy changed from supporting the Americans in Iraq to opposing them .
( But , interestingly , the switch from Silvio Berlusconi to Romano Prodi in Italy is having a less dramatic effect on Italy ’ s foreign policy because of the country ’ s greater defense dependence on the US . )
Naturally , with socialists and social democrats in power in some EU countries , and conservatives in power in others , it is difficult for Europeans to find a single voice .
This may change if a new common threat to Europe emerges , or if conservative parties follow the left and become anti ##AT##-##AT## American .
Given US President George W. Bush ’ s extreme unpopularity in Europe , the emergence of an anti ##AT##-##AT## American right should no longer be considered a remote possibility .
But with Europe enjoying an unprecedented level of economic prosperity as a result of the EU ’ s dramatic accomplishments during its first 50 years , further political unification clearly can wait .
Congratulations , not hand ##AT##-##AT## wringing , should be the order of the day .
The G ##AT##-##AT## 8 Summit in Japan earlier this month was a painful demonstration of the pitiful state of global cooperation .
The world is in deepening crisis .
Food prices are soaring . Oil prices are at historic highs .
The leading economies are entering a recession .
Climate change negotiations are going around in circles . Aid to the poorest countries is stagnant , despite years of promised increases .
And yet in this gathering storm it was hard to find a single real accomplishment by the world ’ s leaders .
The world needs global solutions for global problems , but the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 leaders clearly cannot provide them .
Because virtually all of the political leaders that went to the summit are deeply unpopular at home , few offer any global leadership .
They are weak individually , and even weaker when they get together and display to the world their inability to mobilize real action .
There are four deep problems .
The first is the incoherence of American leadership .
While we are well past the time when the United States alone could solve any global problems , it does not even try to find shared global solutions .
The will to global cooperation was weak even in the Clinton administration , but it has disappeared entirely during the Bush administration .
The second problem is the lack of global financing .
The hunger crisis can be overcome in poor countries if they get help to grow more food .
The global energy and climate crises can be overcome if the world invests together to develop new energy technologies .
Diseases such as malaria can be overcome through globally coordinated investments in disease control .
The oceans , rainforests , and air can be kept safe through pooled investments in environmental protection .
Global solutions are not expensive , but they are not free , either .
Global solutions to poverty , food production , and development of new clean energy technology will require annual investments of roughly $ 350 billion , or 1 % of GNP of the rich world .
This is obviously affordable , and is modest compared to military spending , but is far above the pittance that the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 actually brings to the table to solve these urgent challenges .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has made a valiant effort to get the rest of Europe to honor the modest aid pledges made at the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 Summit in 2005 , but it has been a tough fight , and one that hasn ’ t been won .
The third problem is the disconnection between global scientific expertise and politicians .
Scientists and engineers have developed many powerful ways to address today ’ s challenges , whether growing food , controlling diseases , or protecting the environment .
And these methods have become even more powerful in recent years with advances in information and communications technology , which make global solutions easier to identify and implement than ever before .
The fourth problem is that the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 ignores the very international institutions – notably the United Nations and the World Bank – that offer the best hope to implement global solutions .
These institutions are often deprived of political backing , underfinanced , and then blamed by the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 when global problems aren ’ t solved .
Instead , they should be given clear authority and responsibilities , and then held accountable for their performance .
President Bush may be too unaware to recognize that his historically high 70 % disapproval rating among US voters is related to the fact that his government turned its back on the international community – and thereby got trapped in war and economic crisis .
The other G ##AT##-##AT## 8 leaders presumably can see that their own unpopularity at home is strongly related to high food and energy prices , and an increasingly unstable global climate and global economy , none of which they can address on their own .
Starting in January 2009 with the new US president , politicians should take the best chance for their own political survival , and of course for their countries ’ well ##AT##-##AT## being , by reinvigorating global cooperation .
They should agree to address shared global goals , including the fight against poverty , hunger , and disease ( the Millennium Development Goals ) , as well as climate change and environmental destruction .
To achieve these goals , the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 should set clear timetables for action , and transparent agreements on how to fund it .
The smartest move would be to agree that each country tax its CO2 emissions in order to reduce climate change , and then devote a fixed amount of the proceeds to global problem solving .
With the funding assured , the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 would suddenly move from empty promises to real policies .
Backed by adequate funding , the world ’ s political leaders should turn to the expert scientific community and international organizations to help implement a truly global effort .
Rather than regarding the UN and its agencies as competitors or threats to national sovereignty , they should recognize that working with the UN agencies is in fact the only way to solve global problems , and therefore is the key to their own political survival .
These basic steps – agreeing on global goals , mobilizing the financing needed to meet them , and identifying the scientific expertise and organizations needed to implement solutions – is basic management logic .
Some may scoff that this approach is impossible at the global level , because all politics are local .
Yet today , all politicians depend on global solutions for their own political survival .
That by itself could make solutions that now seem out of reach commonplace in the future .
Time is short , since global problems are mounting rapidly .
The world is passing through the greatest economic crisis in decades .
It ’ s time to say to the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 leaders , “ Get your act together , or don ’ t even bother to meet next year . ” It ’ s too embarrassing to watch grown men and women gather for empty photo opportunities .
NEW YORK – One odd and disturbing aspect of global politics today is the confusion between negotiations and problem ##AT##-##AT## solving .
According to a timetable agreed in December 2007 , we have six months to reach a global agreement on climate change in Copenhagen .
Governments are engaged in a massive negotiation , but they are not engaged in a massive effort at problem ##AT##-##AT## solving .
Each country asks itself , “ How do I do the least and get the other countries to do the most ? , ” when they should be asking instead , “ How do we cooperate to achieve our shared goals at minimum cost and maximum benefit ? ”
These might sound like the same thing , but they are not .
Addressing the problem of climate change requires reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels , which in turn involves choices in technology , some of which already exists and much of which needs to be developed .
For example , coal plants , if they are to remain a major part of the energy mix , will need to capture and store their CO2 , a process called “ carbon capture and sequestration , ” or CCS for short .
Yet this technology remains unproved .
Similarly , we will need renewed public confidence in a new generation of nuclear power , with plants that are safe and reliably monitored .
We will need new technologies to mobilize large ##AT##-##AT## scale solar power , wind power , and geothermal power .
We might try to tap bio ##AT##-##AT## fuels , but only in forms that do not compete with food supplies or with precious environmental assets .
The list goes on .
We will need improved energy efficiency , through “ green buildings ” and more efficient appliances .
We will need to switch from cars with internal ##AT##-##AT## combustion engines to hybrids , plug ##AT##-##AT## in hybrids , battery ##AT##-##AT## powered , and fuel ##AT##-##AT## cell ##AT##-##AT## powered vehicles .
Achieving a new generation of electric vehicles will require a decade of public and private partnership to achieve basic technological development ( such as improved batteries ) , a more robust electric grid , new infrastructure for re ##AT##-##AT## charging the automobiles , and much more .
Similarly , it will take a decade of public and private investments to demonstrate the feasibility of coal ##AT##-##AT## fired plants that capture their carbon dioxide .
The switchover to new technologies is not mainly a matter of negotiation but of engineering , planning , financing , and incentives .
How can the world most effectively develop , demonstrate , and then spread these new technologies ?
Where the benefits are unlikely to accrue to private investors , who should pay for the early demonstration models , which will require billions of dollars ?
How should we preserve private incentives for research and development while committing to transfer successful technologies to developing countries ?
These are pressing , unsolved questions .
Yet the global negotiations on climate change are focusing on a different set of questions .
The negotiations are mainly about which groups of countries should cut their emissions , by how much , how fast , and relative to which baseline year .
Countries are being pressed to cut emissions by 2020 by certain percentage targets , without much serious discussion about how the cuts can be achieved .
The answers depend , of course , on which low ##AT##-##AT## emission technologies will be available , and on how fast they can be deployed .
Consider the United States .
To cut emissions sharply , the US will need to switch over this decade to a new fleet of automobiles , powered increasingly by electricity .
The US will also have to decide on the renewal and expansion of its nuclear power plants , and on the use of public lands to build new renewable energy plants , especially using solar power .
And the US will need a new power grid to carry renewable energy from low ##AT##-##AT## density population sites – such as the southwestern deserts for solar power and the northern plains for wind power – to the high ##AT##-##AT## density populations of the coasts .
Yet all of this requires a national plan , not simply a numerical target for emissions reduction .
Similarly , China , like the US , can reduce CO2 emissions through increased energy efficiency and a new fleet of electric vehicles .
But China must consider the question from the vantage point of a coal ##AT##-##AT## dependent economy .
China ’ s future choices depend on whether “ clean coal ” can really work effectively and on a large scale .
Thus , China ’ s emissions path depends crucially on early testing of the CCS technologies .
A true global brainstorming approach would first discuss the best technological and economic options available , and how to improve these options through targeted research and development and better economic incentives .
The negotiations would discuss the range of options open to each country and region – from CCS to solar , wind , and nuclear power – and would sketch a timetable for a new generation of low ##AT##-##AT## emission automobiles , recognizing that market competition as well as public financing will set the actual pace .
Based on these building blocks , the world could agree on allocating the costs for speeding the development and spread of new low ##AT##-##AT## emission technologies .
This global framework would underpin national and global targets for emissions control and for monitoring the progress of the technological overhaul .
As new technologies are proven , the targets would become more stringent .
Of course , part of the strategy would be to create market incentives for new low ##AT##-##AT## emission technologies , so that inventors could develop their own ideas with the prospect of large profits if those ideas are right .
My plea to discuss plans and strategies alongside specific emissions targets might seem to risk impeding the negotiations .
But if we don ’ t have a strategy to accompany our targets , the world ’ s governments might not accept such targets in the first place , or might accept them cynically , without any intention of actually meeting them .
We need to think hard , and collaboratively , about the world ’ s real technological options , and then pursue a common global framework that allows us to move into a new era , one based on feasible and sustainable technologies for energy , transport , industry , and buildings .
Television and newspapers continue to trumpet every twist and turn of global financial markets .
In truth , however , the big story is the uneerie calm that has engulfed virtually every major asset class , from stocks to bonds .
Is the whole investment world on Prozac ?
Conspiracy theories abound , particularly among the ranks of financial traders , for whom volatility is like wind to a sailor .
These traders confidently figure that as long as markets gyrate , no matter what the direction , they can always make money .
And , thanks to the rest of us who don ’ t have the time , information , and skill to match wits with them , they are mostly right .
But , with today ’ s dormant markets , the pickings are slim .
The favored bogeymen of the day are giant government investors , particularly Asian central banks , with their trillions of dollars in assets .
These superfunds , whose managers do not necessarily share the same passion for profit as private investors , are said to be squeezing the life out of interest rates and exchange rates . “ The big Asian central banks are oppressing us , ” one young trader recently complained to me .
What a difference a decade makes .
During the 1990 ’ s , private investors looked at big , lumbering central banks as cash cows , long on money and short on financial acumen .
George Soros once made a billion dollars off the Bank of England in just an hour .
His basic strategy was a standard one : bet against any central bank that tries to defend an inconsistent macroeconomic policy .
Traders did not win every battle , of course .
It was the speculators whose blood flowed in the streets when they attacked Hong Kong ’ s dollar peg in 1998 .
But overall , betting against big government financial institutions proved to be a richly rewarding business .
That was the 1990 ’ s .
Today , many traders see formerly inept state giants as financial geniuses , capable of taming complex financial formulas and exploiting their superior size and trading information to squeeze the life out of currency and interest rate markets .
These behemoths ’ innate conservatism , having calmed bond and currency markets , is now having a similar effect on stocks .
Although few accuse Asian central banks of explicitly conspiring to calm global markets , some say that their common cautious approach to trading is a form of implicit collusion .
As much as we may sympathize with young would ##AT##-##AT## be millionaire traders , does their story of oppression make any sense ?
Could it be true that huge government investors from Asia ( not to mention Russia , Latin America , and the Middle East ) have quietly taken control of world markets ?
Perhaps , but the bogeyman theory seems a bit overblown .
Yes , the big Asian central banks do sit on almost $ 3 trillion in assets ; China ’ s central bank alone has around a trillion dollars .
This gives them a capital base similar to the combined assets of all the world ’ s major hedge funds .
But this metric is very deceptive .
Hedge funds constitute only a small percentage of overall world financial markets , which , according to a recent study by the McKinnsey Global Institute , now exceed $ 120 trillion .
And hedge funds , unlike banks , can leverage their bets , borrowing to take on assets many times the size of their capital base .
Otherwise , George Soros and his wealthy fellow investors could not have dreamed of taking on the Bank of England .
In fact , the explanation for market calm probably lies elsewhere .
So , if a conspiracy of Asian central banks is not to blame for the volatility drought that is parching traders ’ earnings , what is ?
Surely , today ’ s low volatility is partly cyclical .
Stock market volatility was also very low during the early 1990 ’ s , before reaching new peaks later in the decade .
Moreover , financial innovation and globalization allow markets to spread risk more effectively than ever before , placing it in the hands of those who can best manage it .
Improved central bank policy is another huge factor .
In the early 1990 ’ s , the average level of world inflation exceeded 30 % ; now it is less than 4 % .
All of these changes have in turn contributed to lower economy ##AT##-##AT## wide output and consumption volatility in both rich and developing countries .
They have also contributed mightily to the high general level of asset prices , helping create the vast riches of which today ’ s hungry young traders are so jealous .
So will today ’ s relative market calm continue ?
Unfortunately , no .
Today ’ s brave new world of financial globalization will almost surely face severe new stress tests , reminding us that recessions still happen .
Frankly , although I do not see the five ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old global expansion coming to an end yet , there is no question that risks are on the rise , with output in the United States having slowed sharply in the third quarter , and central banks ’ hands tied by inflation risks .
Further ahead , it is not hard to imagine geopolitical instability – possibly emanating from Iran , Iraq , or North Korea – unsettling markets .
Whatever the scenario that ends the calm , today ’ s age of low volatility will seem like a distant dream to most of us – and a forgotten nightmare for ambitious financial traders .
As the global financial crisis transforms itself inexorably into economic crisis and now industrial crisis , the cry “ where ’ s Europe ? ” can be heard across the EU .
So far , Brussels ’ response has been less than reassuring .
The European Commission ’ s watchword has been that the integrity of the Single Market must be defended at all costs , and that it will use its formidable legal powers to ensure that bailouts and other state aid by EU governments do not distort fair competition .
It is a familiar mantra , and among industrialists the mood now seems to be hardening that it is not enough .
With anxiety mounting across Europe that industrial lay ##AT##-##AT## offs will mean major plant closures and cascading job losses in thousands of smaller companies , national governments find themselves on a collision course with the EU , though they know that their best chance of salvation lies in concerted European action .
In Brussels , there is awareness that the crisis offers real political opportunity , even if the Commission has yet to grasp it .
The time has come for a new EU industrial ##AT##-##AT## policy framework that would permit Brussels to use its “ honest broker ” status to manage competing interests .
The Commission ’ s eurocrats should dust ##AT##-##AT## off their files from 30 years ago and recall how their predecessors handled the steel crisis that then threatened to provoke an intra ##AT##-##AT## European trade war .
In the late 1970 ’ s , the Commission declared a state of “ manifest crisis ” and agreed with member governments the details of what came to be called the Davignon Plan .
Drawn up by the Belgian member of the Commission who held the industry portfolio , several of its provisions are clearly relevant to the current situation , not least to the automobile industry .
The Davignon Plan imposed Europe ##AT##-##AT## wide production and price controls , monitored and coordinated national governments ’ state aids , organized the closures of outdated plants , encouraged mergers , and awarded EU funding to retraining schemes for redundant steel workers .
Its overall aim was to make the backbone of Europe ’ s heavy ##AT##-##AT## engineering sector more competitive internationally .
The plan ’ s author , Vicomte Etienne Davignon , recently commented in the Belgian press that he can ’ t understand why the Commission is not doing something similar today .
“ To do so would legitimate national aids ( to carmakers ) but would ensure they are based on a common EU ##AT##-##AT## level strategy , ” he wrote .
The signals from the Commission , though , are not encouraging .
Industry commissioner Gunther Verheugen recently reacted to calls by both General Motors and Renault for a more “ proactive ” EU role in coordinating bailouts by saying : “ There will be no sector ##AT##-##AT## specific plans whatsoever . ” He emphasized that Brussels has neither the funds nor the desire to rescue the motor industry , and sees little similarity between the systemic risks of the financial services sector and the problems faced by the manufacturing branches .
That will be a matter of opinion until the recession begins to abate ; the truth is that we don ’ t yet know whether this crisis will be a snowball that grows layer by layer or an avalanche that sweeps away entire industries .
In either case , the Single Market will come under increasing pressure .
The Commission rightly says that in this age of globalization there is no longer such a thing as a national carmaker , but there are still national plants and national payrolls that politicians facing elections will be desperate to defend .
It doesn ’ t really matter whether a new crisis ##AT##-##AT## beating EU strategy bears some resemblance to the largely forgotten Davignon Plan .
The important point is that Europe should be seen to have set out a common framework for addressing the slowdown .
Eurocrats insist that the necessary policy instruments and rules are already in place , but that is to ignore political reality .
Unless the EU ’ s internal ##AT##-##AT## market rules can be made more flexible , member governments will flout them .
The crisis has also underscored a longer ##AT##-##AT## term need for a more concerted EU approach to industrial policy .
There is a growing awareness in Europe that the crisis is set to re ##AT##-##AT## shape our industrial base , as Asian countries take over from the EU and the United States many of their advanced technology fiefdoms .
But Europe ’ s 10 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old Lisbon strategy to secure global high ##AT##-##AT## tech leadership is widely discredited , which is a further reason to include a large R &amp; amp ; D component in any EU ##AT##-##AT## wide industrial program .
Presentation is an essential part of any political process , and it ’ s the part where the European Commission is least competent .
Industrial leaders and ordinary citizens alike want to be told that the EU is working on a policy approach that looks farther ahead than the gloomy present .
Verve and fanfare may be alien to Brussels , but what is urgently required is a sense of political showmanship that restores confidence in the European project as well as the economy .
Deciphering the human genome has provided insights into the nature of humanity , our relationship to the world , and our future .
We now have the set of instructions that specifies human development--how each of us progressed from a single cell ( a fertilized egg ) to an adult human comprising a hundred trillion cells of thousands of different types .
So what comes next ?
The genome &apos;s language is DNA , whose alphabet has just four different letters : G , C , A , and T. But the genome contains three billion of these letters .
The Human Genome Project translated them into a &apos; Book of Life , &apos; that consists of 500 volumes , each with 1,000 pages averaging 1,000 six ##AT##-##AT## letter words per page .
Operationally , the human genome is composed of one long sentence of three billion letters cut into 24 pieces--chromosomes--that range in size from 45 ##AT##-##AT## 280 million letters .
In a book , words are collected into sentences , sentences into paragraphs , and paragraphs into chapters .
Each level provides a higher , more coherent level of meaning .
So , too , with the human genome .
DNA &apos;s words are genes , which encode proteins--the molecular building blocks of life .
Genes and proteins are , in turn , gathered into the biological systems-- heart , brain , kidneys , and so forth--that execute the functions of life .
The first draft of the human genome , published in February 2001 , provided four new fundamental insights .
First , humanity &apos;s Book of Life has only 30,000 ##AT##-##AT## 35,000 different words , or genes .
This is surprising , because the genome of a tiny worm that had been sequenced earlier contains about 20,000 genes .
How we make do with only one ##AT##-##AT## third more genes than this simple worm remains an unanswered puzzle .
Second , there are essentially no race ##AT##-##AT## specific words in the Book of Life .
Indeed , the Book of Life for two Black people may differ more than that for a Caucasian person and a Black person .
The concept of race is cultural , not genetic .
Third , the Books of Life for humans , fish , flies , and yeast contain a large number of shared words ( although the spellings are somewhat different ) .
Many fundamental biological systems composed of these genes and proteins are remarkably similar .
This underscores the descent of all life from a single common ancestor .
The fourth observation similarly highlights the interconnectedness of all life .
For example , the Book of Life for humans contains around 200 genes derived from other organisms , contradicting the long ##AT##-##AT## held view that all of our genes are transmitted vertically , from grandparents to parents to children .
It seems that evolution also occurs in a horizontal context , in which any living creature can incorporate information from surrounding organisms .
The knowledge contained in the Book of Life has catalyzed paradigm changes in biology and medicine .
We can now study a biological system in terms of how all of its components interact rather than one gene or one protein at a time .
Indeed , the Institute for Systems Biology , which I co ##AT##-##AT## founded two years ago , reflects my conviction that systems approaches will dominate biological study in the 21st century .
The paradigm change in medicine will be similarly radical .
The next 10 ##AT##-##AT## 15 years will see a shift away from our current reactive model--you come in when you get sick and the physician attempts to make you well--to a predictive , preventive , and ultimately a personalized form of medicine .
For example , if you are a woman with a single bad copy of the breast cancer 1 gene , you have a 70 % chance of getting breast cancer by the time you are 60 years old .
Why only a 70 % chance ?
In some cases , defective genes require certain environmental signals to be activated , while another , more likely , explanation is that single defective genes are not enough to cause disease ; a number of defective genes must act in concert .
The important point is that within the next 10 ##AT##-##AT## 15 years we will have identified hundreds of genes that predispose individuals to virtually all of the common , late ##AT##-##AT## onset diseases , such as cancer and cardiovascular , neurological , and metabolic diseases .
We will be able to take a blood sample , determine the possibility of genetic defects , and create a probabilistic health history of what is likely to happen .
Physicians will be able to study your genes in the context of the biological systems within which they operate and learn how to circumvent the limitations they impose .
The predictive , preventive and personalized medicine of the future could include changes in environment , specially designed drugs , gene engineering , and embryonic stem cells .
All of this will propel us into a very different world , one that may well extend humans &apos; life span by 10 ##AT##-##AT## 30 years , presenting enormous opportunities , but also confronting us with fascinating and perplexing ethical , social , and legal issues .
How , for example , can we capture the enormous potential increase in creativity and productivity if the average human life span is extended into the 90 &apos;s or even beyond ?
Who gets to know about predictive health histories ?
Will we permit doctrinaire religious views to block our ability to explore the enormous potential of embryonic stem cells and thereby lift the yoke of disease from tens of millions of people ?
These questions underscore our obligation to keep abreast of advances in science and technology , so that we may use the opportunities they provide to better humankind while dealing thoughtfully and rationally with the challenges they present .
CAMBRIDGE – The world economy will shrink this year for the first time since 1945 , and some economists worry that the current crisis could spell the beginning of the end of globalization .
Hard economic times are correlated with protectionism , as each country blames others and protects its domestic jobs .
In the 1930 ’ s , such “ beggar ##AT##-##AT## thy ##AT##-##AT## neighbor ” policies worsened the situation .
Unless political leaders resist such responses , the past could become the future .
Ironically , however , such a grim prospect would not mean the end of globalization , defined as the increase in worldwide networks of interdependence .
Globalization has several dimensions , and , though economists all too often portray it and the world economy as being one and the same , other forms of globalization also have significant effects – not all of them benign – on our daily lives .
The oldest form of globalization is environmental .
For example , the first smallpox epidemic was recorded in Egypt in 1350 BC .
It reached China in 49 AD , Europe after 700 , the Americas in 1520 , and Australia in l789 .
Bubonic plague , or the Black Death , originated in Asia , but its spread killed a quarter to a third of Europe ’ s population in the fourteenth century .
Europeans carried diseases to the Americas in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that destroyed up to 95 % of the indigenous population .
In 1918 , a flu pandemic caused by a bird virus killed some 40 million people around the world , far more than the recently concluded world war .
Some scientists today predict a repeat of an avian flu pandemic .
Since 1973 , 30 previously unknown infectious diseases have emerged , and other familiar diseases have spread geographically in new , drug ##AT##-##AT## resistant forms .
In the 20 years after HIV / AIDS was identified in the 1980 ’ s it killed 20 million people and infected another 40 million around the world .
Some experts project that that number will double by 2010 .
The spread of foreign species of flora and fauna to new areas has wiped out native species , and may result in economic losses of several hundred billion dollars per year .
Global climate change will affect the lives of people everywhere .
Thousands of scientists from more than 100 countries recently reported that there is new and strong evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities , and average global temperatures in the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century are projected to increase between 2.5 and 10 degrees Fahrenheit .
The result could be more severe variations in climate , with too much water in some regions and not enough in others .
The effects will include stronger storms , hurricanes , and floods , deeper droughts , and more landslides .
Rising temperatures have lengthened the freeze ##AT##-##AT## free season in many regions , and glaciers are melting .
The rate at which the sea level rose in the last century was ten times faster than the average rate over the last three millennia .
Then there is military globalization , consisting of networks of interdependence in which force , or the threat of force , is employed .
The world wars of the twentieth century are a case in point .
The prior era of economic globalization reached its peak in 1914 , and was set back by the world wars .
But , while global economic integration did not regain its 1914 level until half a century later , military globalization grew as economic globalization shrank .
During the Cold War , the global strategic interdependence between the United States and the Soviet Union was acute and well recognized .
Not only did it produce world ##AT##-##AT## straddling alliances , but either side could have used intercontinental missiles to destroy the other within 30 minutes .
This was distinctive not because it was totally new , but because the scale and speed of the potential conflict arising from military interdependence were so enormous .
Today , Al Qaeda and other transnational actors have formed global networks of operatives , challenging conventional approaches to national defense through what has been called “ asymmetrical warfare . ”
Finally , social globalization consists in the spread of peoples , cultures , images , and ideas .
Migration is a concrete example .
In the nineteenth century , some 80 million people crossed oceans to new homes – far more than in the twentieth century .
At the beginning of the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century , 32 million US residents ( 11.5 % of the population ) were foreign ##AT##-##AT## born .
In addition , some 30 million visitors ( students , businesspeople , tourists ) enter the country each year .
Ideas are an equally important aspect of social globalization .
Technology makes physical mobility easier , but local political reactions against immigrants had been growing even before the current economic crisis .
The danger today is that short ##AT##-##AT## sighted protectionist reactions to the economic crisis could help to choke off the economic globalization that has spread growth and raised hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the past half ##AT##-##AT## century .
But protectionism will not curb the other forms of globalization .
Modern technology means that pathogens travel more easily than in earlier periods .
Easy travel plus hard economic times means that immigration rates may accelerate to the point where social friction exceeds general economic benefit .
Similarly , hard economic times may worsen relations among governments , as well as domestic conflicts that can lead to violence .
At the same time , transnational terrorists will continue to benefit from modern information technology , such as the Internet .
And , while depressed economic activity may slow somewhat the rate of greenhouse ##AT##-##AT## gas build ##AT##-##AT## up in the atmosphere , it will also slow the types of costly programs that governments must enact to address emissions that have already occurred .
So , unless governments cooperate to stimulate their economies and resist protectionism , the world may find that the current economic crisis does not mean the end of globalization , but only the end of the good kind , leaving us with the worst of all worlds .
When Turkey &apos;s parliament voted in March 2003 against allowing American troops to open a northern front against Iraq , Turkey &apos;s traditional strategic partnership with the United States ended .
The two countries still recognize many mutual interests , but now they manage these interests on a far different basis .
The vote shocked &quot; old Europe &quot; and the Arab world as much as the Bush administration .
Europeans who considered Turkey a potential Trojan horse for America within the European Union were forced to reconsider .
For many Arabs , the vote showed that Turkey was not an American lackey and would not cooperate with American imperial designs , despite close Turkish ##AT##-##AT## Israeli relations .
Long ##AT##-##AT## simmering disagreements between Turkey and the US came to a boil with the emergence of the Kurds of northern Iraq as the Pentagon &apos;s main allies in the Iraq War .
The American administration made it clear that military intervention by Turkey in Northern Iraq would not be tolerated .
That message was confirmed on July 4 , 2003 , when American forces arrested several Turkish Special Forces troops in the town of Sulaimaniya , humiliating them by putting sacks over their head as they took them into custody .
Only intervention by US Vice President Dick Cheney two and a half days later secured the release of the soldiers , who were alleged to have been planning clandestine operations within the Kurdish zone .
Despite ongoing tensions , the Turkish government has been eager to mend relations with America , as it is anxious to have some influence over developments in Iraq .
So the authorities responded quickly to the Bush administration &apos;s request for Turkish troops to join the coalition , although the idea was stillborn - rejected by both the Kurds and the American ##AT##-##AT## appointed Governing Council in Iraq .
America has its own reasons to patch up the relationship .
Turkey &apos;s secular , capitalistic , democratic order has become especially valuable to the Bush administration as it seeks to integrate the wider Middle East into the world system by liberalizing its economy and democratizing its polity .
Thus , America trumpeted its continuing support for Turkish membership in the EU , notably in President Bush &apos;s speech in June at Istanbul &apos;s Galatasaray University - at a bridge that joins Asia and Europe .
But serious bilateral problems remain .
The government is irritated by US occupation forces &apos; neglect of the northern Iraqi bases of the PKK , the Kurdish separatist insurgents who have fought a 15 ##AT##-##AT## year war against Turkey .
More broadly , the government regards the US as too complacent vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis Kurdish political developments and unmoved by Turkey &apos;s concerns about Kurdish independence .
The US , for its part , is unhappy with the government &apos;s objections to unrestricted American use of the Incirlik airbase in southeastern Turkey , as well as by recent tensions with Israel .
In the meantime , Turkey is moving closer to the EU , with the government overcoming nationalistic objections in the Parliament to push through comprehensive reforms .
Turkey also showed its good will over Cyprus , removing a nagging political obstacle to EU membership .
These steps led to the European Commission &apos;s recent recommendation to begin accession negotiations with Turkey .
The EU accession process has also underpinned a shift in Turkish policy on Iraq .
Previously , Turkey viewed Iraq solely in the context of its domestic Kurdish problem .
But widespread European opposition to the war removed the possibility of Turkish military intervention , forcing the government to develop another vision of Turkey &apos;s interests .
At the same time , the Iraqi Kurds also appear to appreciate how much they need a friendly Turkey .
The northern border with Turkey is their lifeline to the outside world .
As a result , Turkey no longer considers a federalized Iraq a threat to its security , as long as each federal unit maintains a measure of ethnic diversity .
Of course , Turkey remains opposed to an independent Kurdistan .
But now its concern is more closely tied to regional politics than to the Kurdish issue .
Turkey has no desire to serve as a strategic counterweight to Iran and believes that only a territorially intact Iraq can continue to play that role .
Furthermore , Turkey is concerned about the possibility of civil war in Kurdistan between the two largest Kurdish factions .
But , unlike either Iran or Syria , Turkey genuinely wishes to see a strong and representative government in Baghdad .
Thanks to EU pressures , Turkey &apos;s domestic Kurdish problem is well on the way to being resolved democratically , with most Kurdish leaders in Turkey expressing their commitment to Turkish unity .
For Turkey to consider military intervention in Kurdistan , EU member states would first have to renege on their commitment to negotiate Turkish accession .
Equally dramatic would be any attempt by the Kurds to forcibly change the demographic balance of the multiethnic city of Kirkuk .
Turkey would prefer that Kirkuk , with its large Turkmen population , be given special status in the forthcoming draft Iraqi constitution .
The US also shows signs of understanding the importance of maintaining a multiethnic Kirkuk and is putting pressure on its Kurdish allies .
Turkish diplomacy has thus become a well ##AT##-##AT## calibrated balancing act , moving closer to European positions in the Middle East , but eager to maintain close relations with the US .
If this approach succeeds , Europe &apos;s bridge to Asia may also become its bridge to America .
Elections in Russia usually somehow signal a political crisis : Boris Yeltsin &apos;s re ##AT##-##AT## election as President in 1996 , for example , seemed to hold off a communist resurrection--not by revolution but through the ballot box .
Elections to the State Duma ( the lower house of Russia &apos;s parliament ) are normally quieter affairs , and the just completed campaign and Duma elections ( NOTE TO EDITORS , the vote is December 7 th ) were certainly silent--deadly silent .
Indeed , so omnipotent is President Vladimir Putin in Russia nowadays that the Duma election would have been scarcely noticed--by the world and Russia alike--were it not for the arrest and imprisonment this autumn of Mikhail Khodorkovsky , the oil industry oligarch who dared to put his money behind two liberal parties opposed to Putin .
Khodorkovsky &apos;s arrest did not galvanize ordinary Russians , who increasingly see elections as beside the point in their difficult lives .
His arrest did , however , shake international confidence in Putin , as well as arouse Russia &apos;s other oligarchs and democratic reformers to seriously fear for their freedoms .
The greater the power , the more dangerous the abuse , said Edmund Burke in 1771 .
Putin exercises a power greater than that allowed any other democratically elected leader , and the manner in which he exercises it is now causing serious concern .
Lord Acton &apos;s phrase about the corrupting effect of power does not yet apply ; Burke &apos;s warning does .
The presidency that Boris Yeltsin created for himself a decade ago--fattened when Yeltsin &apos;s tanks shelled an unruly Duma in 1993--gives Putin astonishing freedom from accountability .
Unlike America &apos;s or Mexico &apos;s president , he need not cajole a congress entrenched behind the ramparts of constitutionally separate powers .
Unlike a British or Spanish prime minister , he cannot be removed by a vote of no confidence .
Unlike Germany &apos;s Chancellor , he is not shackled to a coalition partner who can prevent him going too far .
Unlike Berlusconi in Italy , Lula in Brazil , and Koizumi in Japan , he does not have to face down infighting within his own party .
To the huge power of the Russian presidency Putin adds his own aloof temper and a familiarity , from his KGB years , with the subtle levers of Russia &apos;s bureaucracy .
None of this is necessarily wrong : Russia &apos;s hard times demand a government that can act decisively .
But Putin &apos;s power is pressing hard against the limits of what is permissible in a democracy .
Yeltsin never spread his fingers into the nooks and crannies of government as comprehensively as Putin .
Nothing escapes the eye of the Kremlin--whether it be which buildings are restored in Saint Petersburg or the appointment of minor Russian envoys abroad .
When so much power is concentrated in one place , it is tempting to stifle criticism about how that power is used .
Most complaints about Putin focus on his efforts to silence voices of independent criticism .
In taming the oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky--who balked at accepting his &quot; settlement &quot; whereby Russia &apos;s richest men would keep their business empires , no matter how ill ##AT##-##AT## gotten , if they kept out of politics--Putin did choke the media empires both men used to promote their causes .
In a country where the president names the heads of all Russia &apos;s state television and radio channels , criticism is not so abundant that any of it can afford to be lost .
But Putin &apos;s press policy does not add up to an argument that he ought not to be re ##AT##-##AT## elected next March , when he stands again .
Indeed , on the great issues of policy , as distinct from the murky corners of self ##AT##-##AT## interest , Putin can still be seen as a good president .
Abroad , he has drawn Russia into ever closer cooperation with the West : in much of the &quot; war on terror &quot; and the handling of North Korea , his policy parallels that of America ; elsewhere , rhetoric about &quot; independence &quot; persists , but the real doubts about who is a reliable partner for the West now point to Schroeder &apos;s Germany more than to Putin &apos;s Russia .
At home , Putin has mostly done the right things for Russia &apos;s economy , leaving his government in office long enough to reap the benefits of consistency .
His idea of a &quot; dictatorship of law &quot; satisfies enough Russians to put him solidly in command of the political center .
What is worrying about Putin &apos;s rule is his inability to make Russia &apos;s government more transparent .
All deals are private .
Laws appear as if by magic .
No one knows if the president ordered Khodorkovsky &apos;s arrest or even considered the devastating impact it would inevitably have on investment in Russia .
The problem here is that , by keeping political decision ##AT##-##AT## making in the dark , Russia &apos;s myriad power factions are never held to account .
For example , what &quot; deal &quot; --if any--was struck with Russia &apos;s nuclear industry to allow for the continued construction of nuclear plants in Iran ?
No one knows .
Would the military have been so successful in retarding reform if it had to act in the open ?
In his efforts to &quot; get things done , &quot; Putin prefers to deal directly with powerful industries and lobbies , rather than shape laws through a rather tame Duma .
It is the apparent inevitability of Putin &apos;s re ##AT##-##AT## election next spring that justifies concern about his way of wielding power .
Putin could earn the gratitude of future Russians by coolly re ##AT##-##AT## examining the powers of his office .
Power is best checked by democratically elected institutions--by a Duma with real power and a judiciary with real teeth--not by cutting deals with special interests and military / industrial insiders , or by stacking the government with ex ##AT##-##AT## KGB men who can only intimidate , never inform .
Putin should recognize that the sheer extent of his presidential power makes it essential that the darkest corners of Kremlin decision ##AT##-##AT## making be exposed to daylight .
NEW YORK – Sex crime has a telltale signature , even when those directing the outrages are some of the most powerful men and women in the United States .
How extraordinary , then , to learn that one of the perpetrators of these crimes , Condoleezza Rice , has just led the debate in a special session of the United Nations Security Council on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war .
I had a sense of déjà vu when I saw the photos that emerged in 2004 from Abu Ghraib prison .
Even as the Bush administration was spinning the notion that the torture of prisoners was the work of “ a few bad apples ” low in the military hierarchy , I knew that we were seeing evidence of a systemic policy set at the top .
It ’ s not that I am a genius .
It ’ s simply that , having worked at a rape crisis center and been trained in the basics of sex crime , I have learned that all sex predators go about things in certain recognizable ways .
We now know that the torture of prisoners was the result of a policy set in the White House by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Vice President Dick Cheney , and Rice – who actually chaired the torture meetings .
The Pentagon has also acknowledged that it had authorized sexualized abuse of detainees as part of interrogation practices to be performed by female operatives .
And documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union have Rumsfeld , in his own words , “ checking in ” on the sexualized humiliation of prisoners .
The sexualization of torture from the top basically turned Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay into an organized sex ##AT##-##AT## crime ring in which the trafficked sex slaves were US ##AT##-##AT## held prisoners .
Looking at the classic S and M nature of some of this torture , it is hard not to speculate that someone setting policy was aroused by all of this .
The nonsexual torture that was committed ranged from beatings and suffocation , electrodes attached to genitals , and forced sleep deprivation , to prisoners being hung by the wrists from the ceiling and placed in solitary confinement until psychosis was induced .
These abuses violate both US and international law .
Three former military attorneys , recognizing this blunt truth , refused to participate in the “ military tribunals ” – rather , “ show trials ” – aimed at condemning men whose confessions were elicited through torture .
Though we can now debate what the penalty for water ##AT##-##AT## boarding should be , America as a nation , maintaining an odd silence , still cannot seem to discuss the sexual crimes involved .
Why ?
It ’ s not as if the sex crimes that US leaders either authorized or tolerated are not staring Americans in the face : the images of male prisoners with their heads hooded with women ’ s underwear ; the documented reports of female US soldiers deployed to smear menstrual blood on the faces of male prisoners , and of military interrogators or contractors forcing prisoners to simulate sex with each other , to penetrate themselves with objects , or to submit to being penetrated by objects .
Indeed , the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was written deliberately with loopholes that gave immunity to perpetrators of many kinds of sexual humiliation and abuse .
There is also the testimony by female soldiers such as Lynndie England about compelling male prisoners to masturbate , as well as an FBI memo objecting to a policy of “ highly aggressive interrogation techniques . ”
The memo cites a female interrogator rubbing lotion on a shackled detainee and whispering in his ear – during Ramadan when sexual contact with a strange woman would be most offensive – then suddenly bending back his thumbs until he grimaced in pain , and violently grabbing his genitals .
Sexual abuse in US ##AT##-##AT## operated prisons got worse and worse over time , ultimately including , according to doctors who examined detainees , anal sodomy .
All this may sound bizarre if you are a normal person , but it is standard operating procedure for sex offenders .
Those who work in the field know that once sex abusers control a powerless victim , they will invariably push the boundaries with ever more extreme behavior .
Abusers start by undressing their victims , but once that line has been breached , you are likely to hear from the victim about oral and anal penetration , greater and greater pain and fear being inflicted , and more and more carelessness about exposing the crimes as the perpetrator ’ s inhibitions fall away .
The perpetrator is also likely to engage in ever ##AT##-##AT## escalating rationalizations , often arguing that the offenses serve a greater good .
Finally , the victim is blamed for the abuse : in the case of the detainees , if they would only “ behave , ” and confess , they wouldn ’ t bring all this on themselves .
Silence , and even collusion , is also typical of sex crimes within a family .
Americans are behaving like a dysfunctional family by shielding sex criminals in their midst through silence .
Just as sex criminals – and the leaders who directed the use of rape and sexual abuse as a military strategy – were tried and sentenced after the wars in Bosnia and Sierra Leone , so Americans must hold accountable those who committed , or authorized , sex crimes in US ##AT##-##AT## operated prisons .
Throughout the world , this perverse and graphic criminality has added fuel to anxiety about US cultural and military power .
These acts need to be called by their true names – war crimes and sex crimes – and people in America need to demand justice for the perpetrators and their victims .
As in a family , only when people start to speak out and tell the truth about rape and sexual assault can the healing begin .
NEW YORK – Zimbabwe ’ s election appears , once again , to confirm a truism : Africa only seems to make international headlines when disasters strike – a drought , a coup , a war , a genocide , or , as in the case of Robert Mugabe , grossly incompetent government .
But , over the past several years , a number of sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan countries have attracted unprecedented inflows of foreign capital .
Recent global financial turmoil has only added to Africa ’ s allure , because its frontier markets are less vulnerable to international volatility than are most of the world ’ s more familiar emerging economies .
There are three main reasons why many sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan countries are performing well .
First , high commodity prices yield windfall profits for the region ’ s leading producers of raw materials .
Growing demand for energy , metals , and minerals – particularly in China – has driven unprecedented levels of foreign investment .
Even large pension funds are beginning to take notice .
Moreover , a large number of Africa ’ s poorest countries have benefited from exponential growth in ( primarily United States ##AT##-##AT## based ) philanthropy .
But , while both of these positive trends are likely to continue , a third positive factor may not prove as durable .
Every year , Africans living outside the continent send roughly $ 30 billion to family and friends back home .
These remittances are vitally important for economic stability in several African countries .
An economic slowdown in the US and Europe could substantially slow this infusion of cash , because immigrants are often the first to lose their jobs when recession fears take hold .
At the same time , though Africa ’ s frontier economies are less vulnerable than other emerging markets to global financial turbulence , they are highly vulnerable to political turmoil closer to home .
The three countries that served as pillars of regional stability for the past several years – Nigeria , Kenya , and South Africa – are now too pre ##AT##-##AT## occupied with political troubles of their own to provide the peacekeepers , reconstruction funds , and political pressure that often limit the damage from conflicts elsewhere in the region .
Most of Nigeria ’ s problems are well known .
Militants in the oil ##AT##-##AT## rich Niger Delta region have at times shut down as much as 30 % of the country ’ s oil exports , a vital source of state revenue .
President Umaru Yar ’ Adua has taken concrete steps to tackle elite ##AT##-##AT## level corruption in Nigeria , and appears to have made progress toward a comprehensive peace agreement with the Delta rebels .
But Yar ’ Adua might soon confront a big short ##AT##-##AT## term problem .
The country ’ s National Election Tribunal , having overturned the outcomes of several provincial elections , may well annul the results of last year ’ s presidential race , forcing him to run for president all over again .
While Yar ’ Adua could use the goodwill that he has built up over the past year to win by an even larger margin , the 90 ##AT##-##AT## day election campaign would almost certainly trigger civil unrest , and Nigeria ’ s leadership would be too busy navigating domestic political rivalries to help stabilize conflicts elsewhere in Africa .
Kenya ’ s troubles run deeper .
Solid economic expansion and one of the world ’ s fastest ##AT##-##AT## growing stock markets have not helped the country avert a deepening political crisis and mounting ethnic violence since disputed presidential election results in December .
President Mwai Kibaki , whom international observers accuse of rigging the vote , has hinted at a plan to share power in a unity government , but opposition leader Raila Odinga has heard these promises before .
Odinga worked hard to help elect Kibaki in 2002 , only to see Kibaki renege on a similar pledge .
Despite the alarming escalation in violence , fears of civil war in Kenya are probably exaggerated .
The country ’ s Orange opposition movement has recently won key posts in parliament and , for the moment , is heeding calls for calm from former United nations Secretary ##AT##-##AT## General Kofi Annan and representatives of the African Union .
But no one should expect Kenya to play a stabilizing regional role again anytime soon .
The continent ’ s third pillar , South Africa , will spend 2008 mired in an escalating political feud between Thabo Mbeki , the lame ##AT##-##AT## duck president , and Jacob Zuma , a former deputy who is the newly elected leader of the ruling African National Congress and the leading candidate to succeed Mbeki , his bitter rival , next year .
South Africa ’ s courts have become a political battleground , as Mbeki and his allies use corruption charges to try to cripple Zuma ’ s candidacy .
The resulting political firestorm may well force Zuma to rely on core support from key allies within the country ’ s trade union movement and Communist Party , challenging the political elite ’ s pro ##AT##-##AT## market consensus and provoking debate over the future of South Africa ’ s economic policy .
No countries in sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan Africa will have the economic heft and political self ##AT##-##AT## confidence to replace Nigeria , Kenya , and South Africa as pillars of stability anytime soon .
Regional blocs like the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the Southern African Customs Union ( SACU ) , and the East African Community ( EAC ) will eventually assume larger roles in helping resolve the continent ’ s most intractable diplomatic and economic problems .
But that won ’ t happen this year .
There remain many good reasons for investors to take a chance on Africa ’ s frontier markets .
But it will not necessarily take a drought , a coup , a war , or a genocide to make them think twice .
BEIJING – With the likelihood of a contagious sovereign ##AT##-##AT## debt implosion and European bank failures greatly reduced by the Greek debt deal and the European Central Bank ’ s lending program , it is time to look ahead .
Where do the European Union , the eurozone , and the EU ’ s highly indebted countries go from here ?
Will Europe be able to roll back its welfare states ’ biggest excesses without economic distress and social unrest toppling governments and , in the peripheral countries , undermining already ##AT##-##AT## tenuous agreements with creditors ?
Some good news globally will have an impact on how these questions are resolved .
The United States ’ economy is gradually reviving , albeit slowly by the standards of recovery from a deep recession .
China , Brazil , and India have not decoupled from their customers in Europe and North America , and so are slowing , though a relatively soft landing is likely if Europe ’ s recession is as short and mild as predicted .
The EU ’ s economic output and population are larger than that of the US , so the fate of the 27 EU countries is everyone ’ s business , from New York to New Delhi , São Paulo to Shanghai .
Formed originally as a free ##AT##-##AT## trade area , the eurozone comprises 17 of the countries . Knitting together 17 disparate economies , cultures , and institutions was a monumental undertaking , fraught with risk .
The Lisbon Treaty emphasizes unanimity in decision ##AT##-##AT## making .
With some members inside of the eurozone , and others remaining outside of it , and with disparate economic interests and monetary and fiscal traditions even within the eurozone , agreement is difficult .
That sets the stage for three broad scenarios , each with implications for the European and global economy , the financial and banking system , and relations between the member states and EU institutions .
In the first scenario , a more united and homogeneous Europe emerges from the crisis , enforcing greater restrictions on member states ’ budgets to reduce apparent risk .
Accompanied by a strong , broad eurozone , risk of a future currency crisis remains .
In the second scenario , a two- or three ##AT##-##AT## tiered Europe includes a two ##AT##-##AT## tiered euro , with the weaker countries using a separate “ euro ##AT##-##AT## B ” currency that can float against the stronger economies ’ “ euro ##AT##-##AT## A. ”
This arrangement would hold out the promise to fiscally stressed economies that , if they get their act together , they could rejoin euro ##AT##-##AT## A – and do so more readily than they could from their own currency .
In the final scenario , what emerges is a more decentralized Europe , with less top ##AT##-##AT## down agreement in areas beyond trade and a smaller , more homogeneous eurozone composed of the EU ’ s core economies .
Such a construct would be far more popular with citizens who are unhappy with the accretion of EU power in Brussels and the loss of traditional sovereignty .
Some current euro members – Greece ( and perhaps others ) – would revert to national currencies .
None of these options is easy ; each entails serious difficulties and great risks .
Episodic muddling through may be the best that can be hoped for .
For example , how would Greece ( or any country ) exit the euro in order to cushion the extreme downward wage adjustment required to regain competitiveness , and to avoid the severe social unrest that could result from reining in debt too rapidly ?
As soon as word got out that Greece was seriously considering such a move – well before it could even generate a new drachma currency – euro bank deposits would flee Greece .
As a result , Greece would be forced to impose capital controls .
Some contracts denominated in euros would be subject to Greek law , some to European law , and others – for example , derivatives contracts – to British or US law .
Legal chaos would result .
Yet sticking to the euro and forcing all of the adjustments in wages risks greater unrest ; indeed , it might merely postpone the inevitable .
Governments and the bond market will test the seriousness of the newly agreed fiscal guidelines ( if they are ratified ) .
While talk is tough now , the history of such agreements does not inspire optimism .
Before the financial crisis , even Germany violated the EU Stability and Growth Pact ’ s ( SGP ) deficit limits .
In the US , the 1980 ’ s deficit limits set by the Gramm ##AT##-##AT## Rudman ##AT##-##AT## Hollings law were not met , and , like the SGP , were revised and extended .
Agreements with , and access to , the International Monetary Fund and Europe ’ s new bailout fund provide ( soft ) constraints .
Regardless of how these governance and fiscal issues are resolved , or muddled through , Europe ’ s banks remain a thorny issue .
With the time afforded by the ECB ’ s three ##AT##-##AT## year cheap loans , they have some breathing room to rebuild their capital and clean up their balance sheets .
But , while doing so , they are not likely to be expanding private ##AT##-##AT## sector lending to support economic growth .
European banks are far more thinly capitalized , and account for a much larger share of credit extended , than banks in the US , where much more lending originates in capital markets .
Most large US banks – Citi is an exception – passed US Federal Reserve stress tests recently , with enough capital to withstand a hypothetical deep recession ( 13 % unemployment , a 21 % further fall in home prices , and a 50 % stock ##AT##-##AT## market decline ) .
Europe ’ s stress tests have been much weaker .
Some sort of Brady bond to reduce and extend excessive sovereign debt will be necessary .
We can expect further European turmoil – from banks , sovereign debt , and social unrest in response to even modest welfare ##AT##-##AT## state rollbacks – and clashing visions , within and among countries , concerning the desirability of deeper European integration .
Europe has come a long way from the days when its leaders prophesied that the euro would quickly rival the dollar as a global reserve currency .
Yet no one should write off Europe .
It still has great strengths , and , with sensible reforms , the EU can survive and eventually return to greater prosperity and stability .
But Europe remains closer to the beginning of that process of renewal than to the end .
LAHORE – Pakistan remains the world ’ s never ##AT##-##AT## ending question .
As 2010 concludes , several outstanding issues continue to bedevil the country .
How they are managed in the year ahead will determine not only Pakistan ’ s immediate future and long ##AT##-##AT## term prospects , but also the security of its region and , indeed , much of the world .
It has been said – without exaggeration – that Pakistan faces an existential threat .
The country has not defined a coherent approach towards those who are resorting to terrorism to advance their agendas , both within Pakistan and abroad .
It remains uncommitted to the idea of denying sanctuaries on its territory to Taliban fighters battling American and NATO troops in Afghanistan .
Relations with India have soured in recent months , because Pakistan ’ s government is once again lending diplomatic support to the insurgency in Indian ##AT##-##AT## controlled Kashmir .
Domestic terrorism in Pakistan has taken a heavy human and economic toll .
It is no longer aimed at official support of United States ##AT##-##AT## led anti ##AT##-##AT## terrorism activities .
Sunni Islamic extremists now target minority groups as well as other Muslim sects .
Some 800 liberal and Sufi Islamic scholars have died in targeted killings by extremist groups who receive financial assistance from like ##AT##-##AT## minded people in the Middle East , and some well ##AT##-##AT## known and much ##AT##-##AT## visited Sufi shrines have been bombed .
The economy is in shambles , and unable to meet the International Monetary Fund demands for its continued support .
If the IMF terminates its current program , Pakistan will be unable to service its foreign debt .
Indeed , a senior cabinet minister suggested recently that the international community should write off Pakistan ’ s debts – an amount estimated at $ 40 billion .
The minister of finance forcefully repudiated the suggestion the following day , indicating that the government has not developed a consistent approach towards the faltering economy .
The economy was also badly hurt by the massive floods of 2010 , which caused damage estimated at $ 10 billion .
This damage could lower annual GDP growth by 1 ##AT##-##AT## 1.5 % for several years to come .
In the 2010 ##AT##-##AT## 2011 fiscal year , the IMF estimates that economic output will increase by less than 3 % – one ##AT##-##AT## third the rate expected in neighboring India and less than half that of Bangladesh .
Slower economic growth will cause a shortfall of jobs for new entrants to the workforce , thereby increasing the incidence of poverty .
Indeed , the number of people living in absolute poverty is likely to increase by 10 million , bringing the total to more than 70 million , or 40 % of the population .
Pakistan thus ends 2010 as the sick man of South Asia .
The political system also remains unsettled .
Despite passage in July of the 18th amendment to the Pakistani constitution , which restored it to the form in which it was promulgated in 1973 , political and executive authority remains in the hands of President Asif Ali Zardari .
The changes are supposed to make the executive branch accountable to the elected parliament , expand the prime minister ’ s authority , devolve more power to the provinces , and ensure independence to the judiciary .
In late 2009 , the president also approved the seventh National Finance Commission , which will allocate to the provinces a larger share of the revenues collected by the central government .
But a significant transfer of power from the presidency to parliament , or from the central to provincial governments , has yet to be brought about .
Worse yet , the military remains outside civilian control .
General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani ’ s term in office , which was set to expire in November , was extended by three years .
Thus empowered , the general has been able to exert his influence over foreign policy , in particular in defining the country ’ s relations with the US , India , and Afghanistan .
Even though the US offered $ 2 billion of assistance to the military to be disbursed over a period of 3 ##AT##-##AT## 5 years , Kayani has resisted American pressure to move against the Taliban ’ s sanctuary in North Waziristan , used to stage operations against US and NATO troops in southern and eastern Afghanistan .
So , is a further increase in violence by various extremist groups likely ?
Will the economy collapse if the IMF withdraws its support ?
Will the US increase its pressure by intervening militarily if Pakistan continues to harbor Taliban fighters operating from the tribal areas ?
Will the military subvert the constitutional changes aimed at reforming the political system ?
Despite all the grim news and auguries , there is some hope , owing to the increased political mobilization of Pakistan ’ s middle classes , whose members have finally begun to question those espousing extremism .
The judiciary is also more active , and is attempting to force the executive to remain within the bounds of the constitution .
Moreover , a trade agreement with Afghanistan that allows Afghan goods to cross Pakistan en route to India may be one step towards an improvement of economic relations with that large and rapidly growing neighbor .
Indeed , an able economic team that has been installed in the government seems – at long last – to be addressing some of the economy ’ s deep structural flaws .
As India in the 1990 ’ s and Brazil in the early 2000 ’ s showed , economies in deep distress can recover quickly once the right policies are implemented .
It could also happen in Pakistan , which would help to solve other , seemingly intractable problems .
So all hope is not lost in Pakistan .
On the contrary , 2011 may well prove to be a better year for a battered economy and a political system under stress .
WASHINGTON , DC – Egypt ’ s revolution toppled a dictator in February , but the country ’ s future as a stable , functioning democracy remains uncertain .
The West is , of course , limited in its ability to shape the transition process .
Nonetheless , the potential for constructive influence remains considerable , and it should be responsive to those in Egypt who favor liberal ideas , democratic institutions , and broad distribution of the benefits of economic development .
The upcoming parliamentary elections are but an early stage in a long ( perhaps decades ##AT##-##AT## long ) struggle to define the new Egypt .
Will Egypt gravitate toward Islamic theocracy or adopt a secular government that respects minority rights ?
Which economic policies – statist , liberal , or some combination of the two – will best ensure social justice and broad distribution of prosperity ?
Can civilian control of the military be established ?
Will the regional security structure formed around the United States , Egypt , and Israel survive ?
The November elections will not resolve these fundamental questions , and whether a workable constitutional framework will develop is uncertain .
A parliamentary system of government will likely emerge , including a prime minister and a cabinet , with the strong possibility that the presidency will be politically overshadowed , particularly if the presidential election is delayed .
The central unknown is the composition of the ruling coalition .
It appears unlikely that a single party will emerge from the election with enough parliamentary seats to govern on its own .
So a coalition government will be necessary .
The political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood ( the Freedom and Justice Party ) currently is the best ##AT##-##AT## organized party , and may be in the strongest position to form a majority coalition , including Salafist elements .
By contrast , secular liberal parties have yet to develop effective organizations or project compelling visions for the future .
Although sentiment favoring a secular state is considerable , a coalition that can serve as an alternative or counterweight to the Muslim Brotherhood will be difficult to assemble .
In the near term , the most likely counterweight could be a liberal coalition with a heavy component of former members of deposed President Hosni Mubarak ’ s National Democratic Party ( NDP ) – that is , those who have not been discredited by their association with Mubarak .
Election rules favor those who were organized before the revolution .
Approximately one ##AT##-##AT## third of the new parliament will comprise “ non ##AT##-##AT## party list ” candidates .
Established networks based on family , local loyalties , and tribal affiliations will be key determinants in voting . &amp; # 160 ; These circumstances may favor “ non ##AT##-##AT## party list ” candidates associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and the former NDP , particularly in rural Egypt .
Post ##AT##-##AT## election shifts in the composition of coalitions could complicate the situation , making governance even more difficult .
Power ##AT##-##AT## sharing among coalition partners will be an intricate affair , including behind ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## scenes deals with the military , which will insist on measures to safeguard its interests .
The political atmosphere in Egypt remains volatile .
Expectations of economic improvement are extremely high .
The initial elected government may pay an early political price for failure .
The starting point for the West in trying to assist Egypt ’ s transition must be recognition that patient , long ##AT##-##AT## term engagement will be required .
The effectiveness of this engagement will depend primarily on the persuasiveness of the West ’ s policy prescriptions , rather than on the volume of financial assistance .
G ##AT##-##AT## 8 countries have already pledged support to post ##AT##-##AT## Mubarak Egypt , including economic aid , debt relief , and loan guarantees .
These steps are important , though delivery will be prolonged and the likely impact modest , at least in the near ##AT##-##AT## term .
Egypt has already declined support from the International Monetary Fund .
But , apart from an IMF ##AT##-##AT## backed reform program , if the Egyptian government ’ s policy framework is right , resources will flow from the private sector , including foreign investment supportive of job creation and economic development .
This is the message that Egypt needs to grasp and embrace .
G ##AT##-##AT## 8 governments should urgently and repeatedly undertake quiet , structured , and consistent communications with Egyptian counterparts about the economic reforms needed to bring about prosperity .
It is far too early to judge the strength of internal forces promoting liberal economic policies .
The need for economic growth could intrinsically push policymakers toward market ##AT##-##AT## oriented economic policies ( sensitive to considerations of “ social justice ” ) and an open investment environment .
Powerful forces within the Egyptian business community are silent at the moment , but in time will reassert themselves .
Many business interests with job ##AT##-##AT## creating capacity want the continuation of market ##AT##-##AT## oriented reforms begun a decade ago ( which produced impressive growth rates ) , but support broadening prosperity and rooting out corruption .
Moreover , an independent media might tend to reinforce pro ##AT##-##AT## market and democratic sentiment .
Indeed , Western governments should continue to use their channels to the Egyptian military and future civil leadership to encourage them to uphold the rule of law , to act with restraint , and to respect free expression .
Regional security arrangements will also require careful maintenance .
Finally , countries supportive of a democratic Egypt should focus on encouraging the institutional and social underpinnings of democratic process and market reform .
This depends on the development of a robust civil society , tolerant of open debate , and healthy liberal political parties , as well as active participation by women and an independent media .
Winning broad public support will take time .
Private non ##AT##-##AT## profit organizations and private enterprise , rather than governments directly , are best equipped to provide this type of training and expertise for leadership development and capacity building .
The job of democratic governments is to provide the resources that can make delivery of this aid possible .
CAMBRIDGE : In his first international outing America ’ s new Treasury Secretary Paul O ’ Neill got tripped up – by telling the truth .
During the Clinton Administration , Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and then Lawrence Summers stated that America had a “ strong dollar policy . ”
O ’ Neill reportedly said that “ We are not pursuing ... a policy of a strong dollar . ” Immediately attacked for reversing a long ##AT##-##AT## held policy , he quickly retreated .
Too bad , because his comment made a lot more sense than his predecessors ’ statements .
The truth is , America really doesn ’ t have an exchange rate policy .
When Alan Greenspan ponders the next move in US interest rates , little attention is paid to the dollar ’ s exchange rate vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis the Euro , Yen , or other currencies .
American monetary policy decisions depend on the strength or weakness of the domestic economy and on US inflation .
If the economy is slowing , if there is excess capacity , and if inflation is low , interest rates are reduced ; if the economy is strong , if excess capacity is limited , and if inflationary pressures are growing , interest rates are raised .
Nor does the Fed intervene directly in foreign exchange markets except in extraordinary circumstances .
In only one sense does the US actually pursue a “ strong dollar ” policy : the Federal Reserve ’ s monetary policy is designed to keep inflation low .
The dollar is kept “ strong ” in terms of its purchasing power over US goods and services .
But this is not what markets believed the “ strong dollar ” policy meant . They believed that the strong dollar policy referred to exchange rates .
In this sense , the “ strong dollar ” policy would mean that America has a “ weak Euro ” policy or a “ weak Yen ” policy .
It has no such thing .
So why did successive Treasury Secretaries say that the US has a strong dollar policy ?
Part of the answer is that support for a strong dollar is an easy slogan ; it sounds patriotic .
Moreover , it would have been viewed as hostile if Secretaries Rubin and Summers insisted that they believed in a “ weak Euro ” , even if they were implicitly saying that .
A truer statement for Rubin and Summers would have been to say that America actually has no exchange rate policy , the answer that O ’ Neill tried to give .
Another reason exists for their statements . Some US officials believe that the “ strong dollar ” statements helped stabilize foreign exchange markets , even if American monetary policy was not directed at the dollar ’ s strength vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis the Euro or Yen .
Some believe that , without such statements , the dollar would plunge relative to the Euro and Yen .
After all , if the USTreasury Secretary does not support the dollar , what would sustain its value ?
According to this interpretation , market participants would begin to predict the decline of the dollar .
They would sell dollars in anticipation of its decline . Those currency sales would indeed lead to a collapse of the currency .
The decline in the dollar ’ s value would be a self ##AT##-##AT## fulfilling prophecy .
Self ##AT##-##AT## fulfilling swings in a currency do seem to operate .
Statements about a “ strong dollar ” policy could support the value of the dollar over a short period of time , even years .
But eventually , fundamental economic strengths and weaknesses have more effect on the exchange rate than self ##AT##-##AT## fulfilling prophecies .
If , as now seems to be the case , America ’ s economy is weakening while Europe ’ s economies remain strong , the dollar will weaken vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis the Euro whether or not the US Treasury Secretary promotes the dollar .
A weaker dollar vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis the Euro will help sustain demand in the US as the economy slows .
Similarly , the Yen will tend to weaken vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis both the dollar and the Euro because of Japan ’ s underlying weaknesses .
If statements about a strong dollar policy had any effect at all , they probably helped promote America ’ s financial bubble during 1998 ##AT##-##AT## 2000 .
Investors in the US and the rest of the world believed for this short period that investments in the US guaranteed riches ; this contributed to the boom and bust in US technology stocks .
The naive view that the dollar would always remain strong ( and would strengthen even more ) vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis the Euro added fuel to the capital inflows into America .
Now that the bubble is bursting , US stock markets are down and the dollar is weakening relative to the Euro .
The earlier excesses could bring on a recession in the US this year .
So what should America ’ s exchange rate policy be ?
Basing American monetary policy on domestic business conditions , rather than on the exchange rate , is correct .
Small economies closely integrated with their trading partners might set exchange rate targets , or fix their exchange rate to the currencies of their trading partners , but large and relatively closed economies like the US , EU , and Japan , do better to focus on their own business conditions , letting markets determine the exchange rate .
The dollar should be left to rise or fall vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis the Euro and Yen depending on the underlying strengths and weaknesses of the three economic areas .
In today ’ s context , market forces will probably lead to a further weakening of the dollar vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis the Euro , and a further weakening of the Yen vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis both the dollar and the Euro .
Secretary O ’ Neill therefore had it right , even if his words were clumsy .
America should have neither a strong dollar nor a weak dollar policy , only a policy of sensible domestic monetary policies , and a belief that foreign exchange markets should determine exchange rates .
BERLIN -- Turkey ’ s “ no ” last month ( a vote cast together with Brazil ) to the new sanctions against Iran approved in the United Nations Security Council dramatically reveals the full extent of the country ’ s estrangement from the West .
Are we , as many commentators have argued , witnessing the consequences of the so ##AT##-##AT## called “ neo ##AT##-##AT## Ottoman ” foreign policy of Turkey ’ s Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) government , which is supposedly aimed at switching camps and returning to the country ’ s oriental Islamic roots ?
I believe that these fears are exaggerated , even misplaced .
And should things work out that way , this would be due more to a self ##AT##-##AT## fulfilling prophecy on the West ’ s part than to Turkey ’ s policies .
In fact , Turkey ’ s foreign policy , which seeks to resolve existing conflicts with and within neighboring states , and active Turkish involvement there , is anything but in conflict with Western interests . Quite the contrary .
Turkey is and should be a member of the G ##AT##-##AT## 20 , because , with its young , rapidly growing population it will become a very strong state economically in the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century .
Even today , the image of Turkey as the “ sick man of Europe ” is no longer accurate .
When , after the UN decision , United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates harshly criticized Europeans for having contributed to this estrangement by their behavior towards Turkey , his undiplomatic frankness caused quite a stir in Paris and Berlin .
But Gates had hit the nail on the head .
Ever since the change in government from Jacques Chirac to Nicolas Sarkozy in France and from Gerhard Schröder to Angela Merkel in Germany , Turkey has been strung along and put off by the European Union . Indeed , in the case of Cyprus , the EU wasn ’ t even above breaking previous commitments vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis Turkey and unilaterally changing jointly ##AT##-##AT## agreed rules .
Only now , when the disaster in Turkish ##AT##-##AT## European relations is becoming apparent , is the EU suddenly willing to open a new chapter in the negotiations ( which , incidentally , clearly proves that the deadlock was politically motivated ) .
The eastern Mediterranean , the Aegean , the western Balkans , the Caspian region and the southern Caucasus , Central Asia , and the Middle East are all areas where the West will achieve nothing or very little without Turkey ’ s support . And this is true in terms not only of security policy , but also of energy policy if you ’ re looking for alternatives to Europe ’ s growing reliance on Russian energy supplies .
The West , and Europe in particular , really can ’ t afford to alienate Turkey , considering their interests , but objectively it is exactly this kind of estrangement that follows from European policy towards Turkey in the last few years .
Europe ’ s security in the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century will be determined to a significant degree in its neighborhood in the southeast – exactly where Turkey is crucial for Europe ’ s security interests now and , increasingly , in the future .
But , rather than binding Turkey as closely as possible to Europe and the West , European policy is driving Turkey into the arms of Russia and Iran .
This kind of policy is ironic , absurd , and shortsighted all at once .
For centuries , Russia , Iran , and Turkey have been regional rivals , never allies .
Europe ’ s political blindness , however , seems to override this fact .
Of course , Turkey , too , is greatly dependent on integration with the West .
Should it lose this , it would drastically weaken its own position vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis its potential regional partners ( and rivals ) , despite its ideal geopolitical location .
Turkey ’ s “ no ” to new sanctions against Iran in all likelihood will prove to be a significant error , unless Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan can deliver a real turnaround in Iran ’ s nuclear policy .
This , however , is highly unlikely .
Moreover , with the confrontation between Israel and Turkey strengthening radical forces in the Middle East , what is European diplomacy ( both in Brussels and in European capitals ) waiting for ? The West , as well as Israel and Turkey themselves , most certainly cannot afford a permanent rupture between the two states , unless the desired outcome is for the region to continue on its path to lasting destabilization .
Worse still , while Europe ’ s listlessness is visible first and foremost in the case of Turkey and the Middle East , this lamentable state of affairs is not limited to that region . The same applies to the southern Caucasus and Central Asia , where Europe , with the approval of the smaller supplier countries there , should firmly pursue its energy interests and assert itself vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis Russia , as well as to Ukraine , where Europe should also become seriously involved .
Many new developments have been set in motion in that entire region by the global economic crisis , and a new player , China ( a long ##AT##-##AT## term planner ) , has entered the geopolitical stage .
Europe risks running out of time , even in its own neighborhood , because active European foreign policy and a strong commitment on the part of the EU are sorely missed in all these countries .
Or , as Mikhail Gorbachev , that great Russian statesman of the last decades of the twentieth century , put it : “ Life has a way of punishing those who come too late . ”
SINGAPORE – Luxury ##AT##-##AT## brand companies ’ stock prices plunged in July , after their financial results disappointed investors , owing largely to slower sales in emerging markets , especially in China .
Meanwhile , news reports indicate that high ##AT##-##AT## end shopping malls in India and China are increasingly empty .
What is going on ?
Many analysts had expected emerging markets to generate exponential growth over the next decade .
But now there is talk of how the global crisis is slowing down these economies and killing off discretionary spending .
But a slowdown in China ’ s economic growth cannot really be blamed for slower sales of luxury goods or empty malls .
The annual growth rate of China ’ s $ 7.5 trillion economy decelerated to 7.6 % in the second quarter , from 8.1 % in January ##AT##-##AT## March – hardly a cause for panic .
Moreover , two ##AT##-##AT## thirds of the decline is attributable to slower investment rather than slower consumption .
For all of China ’ s long ##AT##-##AT## term structural problems , it is not exactly slipping into recession .
The real problem is that many analysts had exaggerated the size of the luxury ##AT##-##AT## goods segment in emerging markets .
China is by far the largest emerging ##AT##-##AT## market economy , with 1.6 million households that can be called “ rich ” ( defined as having annual disposable income of more than $ 150,000 ) .
But this is still smaller than Japan ’ s 4.6 million and a fraction of the 19.2 million rich households in the United States .
The number of rich households amounts to barely 0.7 million in India and one million in Brazil .
The point is that developed countries still dominate the income bracket that can afford luxury goods .
The explosive growth recorded by this segment in emerging markets in recent years reflected entry into previously untapped markets , with the subsequent slowdown resulting from saturation .
The number of high ##AT##-##AT## income households is still growing , but not enough to justify the 30 ##AT##-##AT## 40 % compounded growth rates expected by some .
This does not mean that growth opportunities in emerging markets have disappeared , but expectations do need to be recalibrated .
Despite the economic boom of the last decade , China still has 164 million households that can be called “ poor ” ( with annual disposable income of less than $ 5,000 ) and another 172 million that are “ aspirant ” ( between $ 5,000- $ 15,000 ) .
Similarly , India has 104 million poor households and 107 million aspirant households .
The real story for the next two decades will be these countries ’ shift to middle ##AT##-##AT## class status .
Although other emerging regions will undergo a similar shift , Asia will dominate this transformation .
A study by the economist Homi Kharas of the Brookings Institution gives us a sense of the scale of this change .
He estimates that 18 % of the world ’ s middle class lived in North America in 2009 , while another 36 % lived in Europe .
Asia ’ s share was 28 % ( after including Japan ) .
But Kharas ’ s projections suggest that Asia will account for two ##AT##-##AT## thirds of the world ’ s middle class by 2030 .
In other words , Asia will displace not just the West , but even other emerging regions .
This is the real business opportunity .
Of course , the rise of Asia ’ s middle class is not the only change we should expect .
We are in the middle of a social and demographic shift that will both destroy and create consumer markets . The aging of developed markets is well known , but the latest data show that emerging markets are aging at an even faster pace .
China ’ s median age is today 34.5 years , compared to 36.9 years for the US .
However , the average Chinese will be 42.5 years old by 2030 , compared to 39.1 for the average American .
The median Russian will be even older , at 43.3 years .
The impact of aging is already being felt in these countries ’ education systems .
The number of students enrolled in primary schools in China has fallen by 18 % since 1990 , and by an astonishing 33 % in South Korea .
At the other end of the demographic scale , the share of the aged is growing explosively .
Meanwhile , the nature of the basic consuming unit – the household – is also changing rapidly .
In most developed countries , the traditional nuclear family is in severe decline and is being replaced by single ##AT##-##AT## individual households .
In Germany , for example , 39 % of households consist of just one person .
Couples with children now account for barely 19 % and 22 % of households in the United Kingdom and the US , respectively .
Nevertheless , it is not all about consumer atomization .
We are simultaneously witnessing the re ##AT##-##AT## emergence of the multigenerational extended family , with as many as 22 % of American adults in the 25 ##AT##-##AT## 35 age group living with parents or relatives .
By contrast , the extended family is giving way in India to nuclear families , which now account for 64 % of households .
All of these changes will profoundly affect the future of consumer markets .
For example , we need to revise our mental image of the nuclear family from American suburbia to fit the rapidly expanding cities of India .
By the same token , our mental image of the multigenerational extended family needs to include those in the West .
An aging but increasingly middle ##AT##-##AT## class Asia will be at the core of this new consumer landscape .
Corruption undermines the quality of life for people around the world , not only in poor countries .
The US currently is witnessing several corruption scandals .
Even America ’ s Federal Emergency Management Agency , responsible for providing relief after natural disasters and man ##AT##-##AT## made catastrophes , was in the hands of inept political cronies rather than professionals .
When hurricane Katrina struck America ’ s Gulf Coast , that incompetence proved fatal .
All societies require an effective government that can provide vital and irreplaceable public services and infrastructure .
Thus , governments are invested with unique powers , especially the powers of policing and judicial control .
But these powers are also readily abused .
How , then , to ensure that governments are law ##AT##-##AT## abiding as well as strong ?
The best answer , both in theory and practice , is to find ways to hold governments accountable to the people that they serve .
Elections are obviously one method , though campaign financing can be a source of corruption .
Politicians around the world trade favors for cash needed to win elections , and they often use that cash to buy the votes of desperately poor people .
Clear electoral rules and procedures can help ensure transparency , but accountability also comes from the broad society in between elections .
Privately owned newspapers , independent radio and television networks , trade unions , churches , professional societies , and other groups within civil society provide a bulwark against despotism .
In the poorest countries , where illiteracy is high , desperate people are subject to government manipulation , and there is a lack of independent control through the media and professional organizations , governments face only weak control by society .
They tend to be the most despotic and corrupt , not because poor people care less about good governance – on the contrary , their very lives depend on it – but because they lack the means to keep their government disciplined and law abiding .
The result is a trap in which poverty causes bad governance and bad governance causes poverty – a two ##AT##-##AT## way spiral downward that can lead to such extreme deprivation that the government , lacking computers , telephones , information systems , and trained civil servants , couldn ’ t function honestly even if it wanted to .
The end result can be collapse into a kind of anarchy , as in Liberia , Sierra Leone , and Somalia .
One measure of the quality of governance in over 150 countries is provided by Transparency International , an organization dedicated to strengthening civil society in the fight against government corruption .
Transparency International produces an annual ranking of “ corruption perceptions , ” measuring the public ’ s view of the extent of corruption in a country .
In the 2005 rankings , Iceland scored as the least corrupt country , with the Scandinavian countries , New Zealand , and Singapore close behind .
The US ranked seventeenth from the top , a not ##AT##-##AT## so ##AT##-##AT## glorious position for the world ’ s leading power .
In general , the poorer the country , the lower the ranking : tied for last place are Chad and Bangladesh .
A bit of statistical analysis reveals further important patterns .
First , Sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan African countries are less corrupt on average than countries at the same income level in other parts of the world .
For example , Burkina Faso , Ghana , Mali , and Rwanda rank much higher than Bangladesh , Indonesia , Pakistan , and Vietnam .
Yet the Asian countries ’ economies have tended to grow much faster over the past generation .
Corruption therefore cannot be the unique factor that holds Africa back .
Africa ’ s problems have more to do with droughts , malaria , AIDS , and lack of infrastructure .
Poor countries achieve lower levels of corruption when civil rights are protected .
When people have the freedom to assemble , to speak , and to publish their views , society benefits not only by increasing the range of ideas that are debated , but also by keeping corruption in check .
It is no surprise that corrupt regimes routinely clamp down on the press , trade unions , and on professional associations .
In Africa , less corrupt countries like Ghana also have much better protection of civil liberties than more corruption ##AT##-##AT## prone countries like Chad and Ethiopia , which are also even poorer .
Finally , the data show that corruption is highest in oil and gas ##AT##-##AT## producing countries .
In general , natural resources like oil , gas , diamonds , and other precious minerals breed corruption , because governments can live off of their export earnings without having to “ compromise ” with their own societies .
The natural resources are therefore not only a target of corruption but also an instrument of holding power .
Many foreign companies , intent on cashing in , fuel the pathology of corrupt regimes by peddling in bribes and political protection .
The implications for action are clear . By strengthening civil society – through legal rights and long ##AT##-##AT## term economic development – and instituting clear rules to ensure accountability , political despotism and corruption will be brought under control .
We should be uncompromising , therefore , in our defense of civil liberties .
The rich world should offer impoverished regions like sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan Africa more economic support to break out of poverty .
Of course , aid should be directed to specific needs – for example , malaria control , food production , safe drinking water , and sanitation – whose fulfillment can be measured and monitored to resist corruption .
By raising living standards , we would also be empowering both civil society and impoverished governments to defend the rule of law .
WASHINGTON , DC – The world is on the brink of a nasty confrontation over exchange rates – now spilling over to affect trade policy ( America ’ s flirtation with protectionism ) , attitudes towards capital flows ( new restrictions in Brazil , Thailand , and South Korea ) , and public support for economic globalization ( rising anti ##AT##-##AT## foreigner sentiment almost everywhere ) .
Who is to blame for this situation getting so out of control , and what is likely to happen next ?
The issue is usually framed in terms of whether some countries are “ cheating ” by holding their exchange rates at an undervalued rate , thus boosting their exports and limiting imports relative to what would happen if their central banks floated the local currency freely .
The main culprit in this conventional view is China , although the International Monetary Fund is a close second .
But , considered more broadly , the seriousness of today ’ s situation is primarily due to Europe ’ s refusal to reform global economic governance , compounded by years of political mismanagement and self ##AT##-##AT## deception in the United States .
China certainly bears some responsibility .
Partly by design and partly by chance , about a decade ago China found itself consistently accumulating large amounts of foreign reserves by running a trade surplus and intervening to buy up the dollars that this generated .
In most countries , such intervention would tend to push up inflation , because the central bank issues local currency in return for dollars .
But , because the Chinese financial system remains tightly controlled and the options for investors are very limited , the usual inflationary consequences have not followed .
This gives China the unprecedented – for a large trading country – ability to accumulate foreign ##AT##-##AT## exchange reserves ( now approaching $ 3 trillion ) .
Its current ##AT##-##AT## account surplus peaked , before the financial crisis of 2008 , at around 11 % of GDP .
And its export lobby is fighting fiercely to keep the exchange rate roughly where it is relative to the dollar .
In principle , the IMF is supposed to press countries with undervalued exchange rates to let their currencies appreciate .
The rhetoric from the Fund has been ambitious , including at the recently concluded annual meeting of its shareholders – the world ’ s central banks and finance ministries – in Washington .
But the reality is that the IMF has no power over China ( or any other country with a current ##AT##-##AT## account surplus ) ; the final communiqué last weekend was arguably the lamest on record .
Unfortunately , the IMF is guilty of more than hubris .
Its handling of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 ##AT##-##AT## 1998 severely antagonized leading middle ##AT##-##AT## income emerging ##AT##-##AT## market countries – and they still believe that the Fund does not have their interests at heart . Here , the West Europeans play a major role , because they are greatly overrepresented on the IMF ’ s executive board and , despite all entreaties , simply refuse to consolidate their seats in order to give emerging markets significantly more influence .
As a result , emerging ##AT##-##AT## market countries , aiming to ensure that they avoidneeding financial support from the IMF in the foreseeable future , are increasingly following China ’ s lead and trying to ensure that they , too , run current ##AT##-##AT## account surpluses .
In practice , this means fervent efforts to prevent their currencies from appreciating in value .
But a great deal of responsibility for today ’ s global economic dangers rests with the US , for three reasons .
First , most emerging markets feel their currencies pressed to appreciate by growing capital inflows .
Investors in Brazil are being offered yields around 11 % , while similar credit risks in the US are paying no more than 2 ##AT##-##AT## 3 % .
To many , this looks like a one ##AT##-##AT## way bet .
Moreover , US rates are likely to stay low , because America ’ s financial system blew itself up so completely ( with help from European banks ) , and because low rates remain , for domestic reasons , part of the post ##AT##-##AT## crisis policy mix .
Second , the US has run record current ##AT##-##AT## account deficits over the past decade , as the political elite – Republican and Democrats alike – became increasingly comfortable with overconsumption .
These deficits facilitate the surpluses that emerging markets such as China want to run – the world ’ s current accounts add up to zero , so if one large set of countries wants to run a surplus , someone big needs to run a deficit .
Leading Bush administration officials used to talk of the US current ##AT##-##AT## account deficit being a “ gift ” to the outside world .
But , honestly , the US has been overconsuming – living far beyond its means – for the past decade .
The idea that tax cuts would lead to productivity gains and would pay for themselves ( and fix the budget ) has proved entirely illusory .
Third , the net flow of capital is from emerging markets to the US – this is what it means to have current ##AT##-##AT## account surpluses in emerging markets and a deficit in the US .
But the gross flow of capital is from emerging market to emerging market , through big banks now implicitly backed by the state in both the US and Europe .
From the perspective of international investors , banks that are “ too big to fail ” are the perfect places to park their reserves – as long as the sovereign in question remains solvent .
But what will these banks do with the funds ?
When a similar issued emerged in the 1970 ’ s – the so ##AT##-##AT## called “ recycling of oil surpluses ” – banks in Western financial centers extended loans to Latin America , communist Poland , and communist Romania .
That was not a good idea , as it led to a massive ( for the time ) debt crisis in 1982 .
We are now heading for something similar , but on a larger scale .
The banks and other financial players have every incentive to load up on risk as we head into the cycle ; they get the upside ( Wall Street compensation this year is set to break records again ) and the downside goes to taxpayers .
The “ currency wars ” themselves are merely a skirmish .
The big problem is that the core of the world ’ s financial system has become unstable , and reckless risk ##AT##-##AT## taking will once again lead to great collateral damage .
At long last , Gordon Brown is taking over from Tony Blair as Britain ’ s Prime Minister , thus attaining his life ##AT##-##AT## long ambition , as if by right .
That is his first problem .
He has not been elected by anyone – not by the Labour Party , and not by Britain ’ s voters ; he has merely come into an inheritance that he has long thought was his due .
How , then , will Brown acquire legitimacy as Britain ’ s new leader ?
The one thing that is clear is that he will not gain legitimacy if he offers only more of what Blair has been dishing up for the past ten years .
Brown ’ s second problem is the mirror image of the first .
As a senior member of Blair ’ s government throughout its tenure , he shares responsibility for everything that Blair has done .
Political commentators sometimes claim to detect important differences in their underlying political attitudes .
However , in practice , Brown has remained in the shadows , skillfully managing the economy , but remaining silent and enigmatic on vital political issues , and apparently endorsing everything Blair did .
If Brown is to gain legitimacy , he must offer something new ; but he can do that only by distinguishing himself from the Blair legacy in clearly perceptible – and therefore fairly radical – ways .
This will be a difficult trick to pull off .
Perhaps the single most important domestic question Brown faces concerns where he stands on the balance between the free market and the claims of social policy .
Blair ’ s government moved the Labour Party a long way to the right of its traditional priorities of protecting the underprivileged , and to justify the change he re ##AT##-##AT## named the party “ New Labour . ”
In many ways , the Blair government ’ s support of free ##AT##-##AT## market policies turned out to be a shrewd and productive shift .
Britain ’ s economy grew more steadily and rapidly than it had done for several generations , and the tax revenue generated by growth enabled the government to pour money into education and the National Health Service .
But this has come at a price , or rather several prices .
First , inequality has grown at both ends of the income scale .
At the bottom , the proportion of the population with an income below the poverty line increased from 13 % at the start of Blair ’ s government to 20 % now .
That situation is much worse among ethnic minorities .
And , despite the government ’ s efforts , childhood poverty also has increased under Blair .
At the top , the incomes of the mega ##AT##-##AT## rich have soared , with predictable repercussions , especially in the property market .
Public concern about this issue has been made much worse by claims that the rich get even richer by paying little tax .
There was a time when Brown was thought to be a believer in traditional Labour Party values .
Was it true ?
Is it true now ?
What will he say about inequality ?
Unfortunately , Blair and his government are perceived to be tainted by some of the less attractive features of free ##AT##-##AT## market capitalism .
Blair himself seems to prefer to have “ friends ” who are very rich and who will lend him their holiday villas in Tuscany .
This “ closeness ” has led the police to investigate claims that some Labour Party donors have been rewarded with political honors .
In short , Blair ’ s government exudes an aura of sleaze and cronyism .
Can Brown show that he is different ?
The worst part of Blair ’ s legacy , of course , is the war in Iraq .
Many people predicted , and everyone can now see , that the decision to invade was a disastrous error ; that it is having catastrophic consequences , not just for Iraq , but also for the Middle East generally ; and that it has seriously damaged the moral standing of the United States and Britain .
The most critical issue facing Brown is whether he chooses to distance himself from Blair ’ s self ##AT##-##AT## satisfied and delusional claim that the invasion of Iraq was “ the right thing to do . ”
Britain has already reduced its forces in southern Iraq , and is on course to reduce them still further as they hand over “ security ” to the Iraqi police and military .
In reality , of course , the civil and guerrilla war under way in the rest of Iraq means that any security in the south can only be a temporary illusion .
The choice facing Brown is whether to cling silently to the existing policy , in the futile hope that the problem will go away , or explicitly recognize Britain ’ s share in the disaster .
This is partly a question of what to do now in Iraq ; but it is also a question of Britain ’ s relationship with the US .
With hindsight , it is clear that Britain ’ s participation in the Iraq war was driven solely by Blair ’ s determination to stick limpet ##AT##-##AT## like to the US .
Brown believes , and has said , that Britain must always be close friends with America ; and obviously that is the right thing to believe and say .
But is he prepared to make clear that there is a difference between being close friends and going into an illegal and disastrous war just to please George W Bush ?
So far , there is no indication that he will .
While he has publicly regretted the errors in British intelligence about Saddam Hussein , that is merely a way of shifting the blame from the government to the intelligence services .
But it was not the intelligence services that decided to go to war ; it was Tony Blair , with the support of Gordon Brown .
PRINCETON – Now that the economic crisis looks less threatening ( at least for the moment ) , and forecasters are spying “ green shoots ” of recovery , an ever more encompassing blame game is unfolding .
The financial crisis provides an apparently endless opportunity for unmasking deceit , malfeasance , and corruption .
But we are not sure quite who and what should be unmasked .
Leading bankers were initially the most obvious culprits .
They presided over institutions that made large profits for a substantial period of time by mispricing risk , and then argued for public support on the grounds that they were too big to fail .
They appeared arrogant and overpaid , and were easily demonized .
But what about the political process ?
Why were the banks not more closely controlled and better regulated ?
It is not that politicians were “ bought ” in a simple sense ; rather , they convinced themselves that financial innovation opened the gate to greater general prosperity , increased home ownership , and , of course , popular support in elections .
Governments are now vulnerable , and politicians are under attack almost everywhere .
Administrations have collapsed in the Czech Republic , Hungary , Iceland , and Ireland .
Riots and paralyzing strikes have crippled Thailand , France , and Greece .
In Kuwait , the government dismissed parliament .
Britain is convulsed by a scandal about parliamentary expenses that has no equivalent since the attacks on “ old corruption ” in the early nineteenth century .
Recriminations after financial crises have a long history , and they recur in regular cycles .
The stock exchange boom of the early 1870 ’ s was followed by collapse in 1873 and a witch ##AT##-##AT## hunt for those responsible .
In 1907 , J.P. Morgan was first viewed as the savior of the market , and then as the enemy of the commonweal .
In the 1930 ’ s , bankers and finance ministers were accused .
But for the rest of the twentieth century , the backlash cycle seemed to have stopped .
Today the attacks are not limited to the political and financial establishment .
Critics are trying to identify the ideas as well as the interests that were responsible for financial and economic dysfunction .
In this respect , the contemporary crisis is unlike the historical analogies , in that it looks as if financial innovation was driven by a set of intellectual and even technological innovations .
Since it is an economic crisis , most people seeking its intellectual roots are tempted to begin with economists , who , with a few exceptions , look particularly discredited .
The founder of the rational expectations revolution , Robert Lucas , is endlessly quoted as having stated in 2003 in his presidential address to the American Economic Association that the “ central problem of depression ##AT##-##AT## prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes , and has in fact been solved for many decades . ”
It is also clear that academic economists had an impact on policy .
Larry Summers , now the highly influential director of President Barack Obama ’ s National Economic Council , concluded as a young economist that “ financial and monetary shocks are less important sources of depression than we had suspected . ” If the economy was foolproof , and if so many good policy options existed to deal with crisis and distress , there was less need to avoid mistakes .
Things could always be set right retrospectively .
Other academic disciplines have looked rather smugly at the public humiliation of their colleagues in economics .
The non ##AT##-##AT## mathematical appear to have their revenge , as the perils of over ##AT##-##AT## reliance on complex symbolic notation and arcane formulae are relentlessly exposed .
In fact , developments or fashions in other academic disciplines and also in the general culture contributed at least as much to a willingness to engage in absurd risks and to provide and accept valuations of complex and inherently unfathomable securities .
The general cultural developments are sometimes termed post ##AT##-##AT## modernism , which involves the replacement of reason by intuition , feeling , and allusion .
But post ##AT##-##AT## modernism has itself been generated by technology , with which it has a deeply ambiguous relationship .
In contrast to a steam engine or an old ##AT##-##AT## fashioned automobile , whose operations were easily comprehensible , modern automobiles or airplanes are so complicated that their operators have no idea how the technology they are using actually works .
The Internet has created a world in which strict logic is less important than the juxtaposition of striking images .
Post ##AT##-##AT## modernism moves away from the rational culture of the so ##AT##-##AT## called “ modern era . ”
Many people are finding more analogies with medieval life , in which humans were surrounded by processes that they found difficult to comprehend .
As a result , they thought they lived in a world populated by demons and mysterious forces .
The recent era of global finance – perhaps we should speak of it as being past ? – differed from the financial surge of a century ago .
Its cultural manifestations also appeared to be novel .
It was playful , allusive , and edgy – in short , post ##AT##-##AT## modern .
It treated tradition and history not as a constraint , but as a source of ironic reference .
At the era ’ s height , major financial players built vastly expensive collections of highly abstract modern art .
A post ##AT##-##AT## modern neglect or disdain for reality generated the sense that the whole world was constantly shifting and malleable , and might be as transient and meaningless as stock quotations .
An alliance was formed between financial experts who thought they were selling truly innovative ideas , a political elite that endorsed the philosophy of “ regulation lite , ” and a cultural climate that pushed experimentation and the rejection of traditional values .
The result was that every sort of value – including financial values – came to be seen as arbitrary and fundamentally absurd .
When incomprehension no longer produces new heights of prosperity , but rather economic collapse and failure , it is not surprising that it turns to anger .
Finding out who is to blame becomes more and more like the late medieval and early modern search for witches : a way of making sense of a disorderly and hostile universe .
CAMBRIDGE – You don ’ t have to break a sweat to be a finance skeptic these days .
So let ’ s remind ourselves how compelling the logic of the financial innovation that led us to our current predicament seemed not too long ago .
Who wouldn ’ t want credit markets to serve the cause of home ownership ?
So we start by introducing some real competition into the mortgage lending business .
We allow non ##AT##-##AT## banks to make home loans and let them offer creative , more affordable mortgages to prospective homeowners not well served by conventional lenders .
Then we enable these loans to be pooled and packaged into securities that can be sold to investors , reducing risk in the process .
We divvy up the stream of payments on these home loans further into tranches of varying risk , compensating holders of the riskier kind with higher interest rates .
We then call on credit rating agencies to certify that the less risky of these mortgage ##AT##-##AT## backed securities are safe enough for pension funds and insurance companies to invest in .
In case anyone is still nervous , we create derivatives that allow investors to purchase insurance against default by issuers of those securities .
If you wanted to showcase the benefits of financial innovation , you could not have come up with better arrangements .
Thanks to them , millions of poorer and hitherto excluded families became homeowners , investors made high returns , and financial intermediaries pocketed the fees and commissions .
It might have worked like a dream – and until about a year and a half ago , many financiers , economists , and policymakers thought that it did .
Then it all came crashing down .
The crisis that engulfed financial markets in recent months has buried Wall Street and humbled the United States .
The near $ 1 trillion bailout of troubled financial institutions that the US Treasury has had to mount makes emerging ##AT##-##AT## market meltdowns – such as Mexico ’ s “ peso ” crisis in 1994 or the Asian financial crisis of 1997 ##AT##-##AT## 1998 – look like footnotes by comparison .
But where did it all go wrong ?
If our remedies do not target the true underlying sources of the crisis , our newfound regulatory zeal might end up killing useful sorts of financial innovation , along with the toxic kind .
The trouble is that there is no shortage of suspects .
Was the problem unscrupulous mortgage lenders who devised credit terms – such as “ teaser ” interest rates and prepayment penalties – that led unsuspecting borrowers into a debt trap ?
Perhaps , but these strategies would not have made sense for lenders unless they believed that house prices would continue to rise .
So maybe the culprit is the housing bubble that developed in the late 1990 ’ s , and the reluctance of Alan Greenspan ’ s Federal Reserve to deflate it .
Even so , the explosion in the quantity of collateralized debt obligations and similar securities went far beyond what was needed to sustain mortgage lending .
That was also true of credit default swaps , which became an instrument of speculation instead of insurance and reached an astounding $ 62 trillion in volume .
So the crisis might not have reached the scale that it did without financial institutions of all types leveraging themselves to the hilt in pursuit of higher returns .
But what , then , were the credit rating agencies doing ?
Had they done their job properly and issued timely warnings about the risks , these markets would not have sucked in nearly as many investors as they eventually did .
Isn ’ t this the crux of the matter ?
Or perhaps the true culprits lie halfway around the world .
High ##AT##-##AT## saving Asian households and dollar ##AT##-##AT## hoarding foreign central banks produced a global savings “ glut , ” which pushed real interest rates into negative territory , in turn stoking the US housing bubble while sending financiers on ever ##AT##-##AT## riskier ventures with borrowed money .
Macroeconomic policymakers could have gotten their act together and acted in time to unwind those large and unsustainable current ##AT##-##AT## account imbalances .
Then there would not have been so much liquidity sloshing around waiting for an accident to happen .
But perhaps what really got us into the mess is that the US Treasury played its hand poorly as the crisis unfolded .
As bad as things were , what caused credit markets to seize up was Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’ s refusal to bail out Lehman Brothers .
Immediately after that decision , short ##AT##-##AT## term funding for even the best ##AT##-##AT## capitalized firms virtually collapsed and the entire financial system simply became dysfunctional .
In view of what was about to happen , it might have been better for Paulson to hold his nose and do with Lehman what he had already done with Bear Stearns and would have had to do in a few days with AIG : save them with taxpayer money .
Wall Street might have survived , and US taxpayers might have been spared even larger bills .
Perhaps it is futile to look for the single cause without which the financial system would not have blown up in our faces .
A comforting thought – if you still want to believe in financial sanity – is that this was a case of a “ perfect storm , ” a rare failure that required a large number of stars to be in alignment simultaneously .
So what will the post ##AT##-##AT## mortem on Wall Street show ?
That it was a case of suicide ?
Murder ?
Accidental death ?
Or was it a rare instance of generalized organ failure ?
We will likely never know .
The regulations and precautions that lawmakers will enact to prevent its recurrence will therefore necessarily remain blunt and of uncertain effectiveness .
That is why you can be sure that we will have another major financial crisis sometime in the future , once this one has disappeared into the recesses of our memory .
You can bet your life savings on it .
In fact , you probably will .
Who lost Russia ?
This question remains hotly debated in media and policy circles across the West .
The question seems to presuppose , not only that Russia was lost , but also that if someone in America ’ s government , the IMF , or EU headquarters had been paying more attention or had devoted more resources towards helping Russia ’ s government , the results would have been better .
But hardly anyone today thinks the West should have been putting more money into Russia , or even that it should have been helping Yeltsin , and now Putin , to a greater extent than it has been .
An opposing critique , favored by some of George W. Bush ’ s advisors , holds that the Clinton Administration tried too hard to help , not that it did not try hard enough .
There is something contradictory about using the phrase “ Who lost Russia ? ” to mean that the US tried too hard to help .
The harshest criticism comes from those ( including some Bush advisers ) who say America and the West sent money down a rat ##AT##-##AT## hole instead of following the practice adopted to fighting some wildfires B ie , standing back and letting the flames burn themselves out .
All in all , the patiently calibrated approach of the last eight years has been right for the most part .
Few will agree with this , probably not even those responsible for conducting Russia policy over the past years .
So let me add that I do not claim that things are good in Russia , nor that American and Western policy had much positive effect there , nor that there isn ’ t corruption , misery , and their like in abundance across Russia .
Of course , the current situation for the West is more satisfactory , not only from where it was 10 or 20 years ago , when the Soviet Union ’ s fall did not appear even a remote possibility , but also from where it might have been given Russia ’ s economic hardship and social instability .
Russia pulled back from hyperinflation in 1995 ; it has not veered off either toward rightwing dictatorship nor back to Communism ; nor has it entirely degenerated into anarchic chaos .
This is an accomplishment considering that Russia never had historical experience with any sort of democracy or market system .
Russia probably hasn ’ t even done as badly as Ukraine , Belarus , and Central Asia .
But I don ’ t claim that America and the West necessarily had much effect on this outcome B beyond doing what they do best : thriving domestically , and thus making others want to become free market democrats .
What happens in Russia is mainly determined by Russians .
Consider specific policy choices faced by the West and the specific decisions made , not an imaginary menu that includes the option “ Establish the rule of law first , eliminate corruption and inequality , then proceed with market reforms and aid . ”
That combination of choices was never an option .
The West ’ s choices attempted to strike a balance between too much and too little .
The big decisions included :
• approving Russian membership in the IMF in 1992 and immediately giving it a $ 1 billion stand ##AT##-##AT## by arrangement , with the usual conditions ;
• working closely with Yeltsin in the run ##AT##-##AT## up to Russia ’ s presidential election in 1996 and thereafter , despite his personal shortcomings and the dubious “ shares ##AT##-##AT## for ##AT##-##AT## loans ” privatizations of the summer of 1995 ;
• subsequently augmenting the IMF lending agreement by making more resources available even though most of the conditions set previously had not been met , in particular the elimination of unsustainably large Russian budget deficits because of a poorly ##AT##-##AT## functioning national tax collection system ;
• pulling the plug in August 1998 when the IMF program didn ’ t work ( much IMF money having quickly flowed back out of the banking system ) , with the result that the Russians immediately devalued the ruble , defaulted on domestic debt , and imposed controls on capital outflows ( whence contagion spread throughout the world , in the worst phase of the 1997 ##AT##-##AT## 98 financial turmoil ) ;
• adding new conditions to those required for an IMF program in the latter part of 1999 .
Although the odds for success in 1991 ##AT##-##AT## 2 were not great , the West had to try .
Not to try would have sent a signal that the West would never help .
And , despite “ moral hazard , ” about which we now hear so much and which everyone agrees was greatest in respect to nuclear ##AT##-##AT## armed Russia , the West did let Russia default in 1998 .
This was a lesson for the world B debtors and creditors alike B that conditionality is more than mere rhetoric , and bailouts are not unlimited .
Europeans complain that the US used the IMF as a tool for its purposes .
It may be true that the mandate of the IMF , which is supposed to make decisions strictly on objective economic criteria rather than broader political goals , was stretched at times .
America , in particular , may have given Russia more attention than another country would have .
But the basic IMF principle of conditionality was not twisted until unrecognizable .
In the real world there was no other way of helping .
Everyone , not just Americans , has a stake in Russia prospering peacefully .
In general , the guiding principle in the future should be to continue to stand ready to help Russia if social and political conditions supportive of the rule of law and economic reform manifest themselves .
Standing ready includes mustering more domestic support for assistance than is currently available , not whipping up anti ##AT##-##AT## Russian feelings with supposedly new discoveries of money ##AT##-##AT## laundering .
But support should always be conditional on fundamentals .
In the end , the West must recognize that much of the time there is little that can be done .
PARIS – “ Who lost Turkey ? ” That question , often raised in the past , has been heating up in the aftermath of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’ s emotional outburst during the recent World Economic Forum 2009 in Davos , when he abruptly left a panel he was sharing with Israeli President Shimon Peres .
And the Turkish question matters greatly , because it touches on some of the most unstable and unsettling of the world ’ s diplomatic disputes .
If Turkey has indeed been “ lost , ” those responsible include the European Union , the United States , Israel , and Turkey itself .
The EU ’ s growing reservations about Turkey ’ s membership have been expressed unambiguously by French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
In the US , former President George W. Bush gets some of the blame because of the war in Iraq .
Israel , too , has played its part in Turkey ’ s alienation from the West , as a result of the Lebanon war of 2006 and its recent military operations in Gaza .
All of these events have disturbed and disoriented Turkey , and are magnified by the domestic impact of worst global economic crisis since the 1930 ’ s .
Of course , Turkey ’ s secular , pro ##AT##-##AT## Western elites may still consider the EU and the US important , if not indispensable , allies and partners , and they may consider Islamic fundamentalism , Hamas , Hezbollah , and Iran real or at least potential threats .
Yet they are also convinced that Europe has behaved improperly toward Turkey , through a combination of short ##AT##-##AT## term populist reflexes and the absence of a long ##AT##-##AT## term strategic vision .
The Turkish question is , of course , complex .
Turkey ’ s geography is predominantly Asian , Turkey ’ s emotions are increasingly Middle Eastern , i.e. , Muslim on the Israeli ##AT##-##AT## Palestinian conflict , and yet Turkey ’ s elites remain resolutely pro ##AT##-##AT## Western and pro ##AT##-##AT## European .
But for how long ?
At the beginning of the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century , when dialogue with the Islamic world is one of the Western world ’ s key challenges , Europe would commit a historic strategic blunder if it were to close its doors to Turkey .
To do so would push back the inheritors of the Ottoman Empire back onto an Asian , Muslim , and Middle Eastern historical trajectory .
In the question of Turkish accession to the EU , the journey matters more than the destination .
The reforms that Turkey has already implemented in a very short period of time , thanks to its EU candidate status , are impressive .
Should we in Europe really put at risk that progress by expressing an all ##AT##-##AT## too ##AT##-##AT## audible “ no ” ?
The EU desperately needs a strategic and diplomatic partner that can significantly reinforce its clout in the Middle East .
Europe also needs the dynamism of a youthful Turkey .
Above all , it needs the message of reconciliation sent to Islam that Turkey ’ s entrance into the Union would represent .
Of course , to want Turkey “ in ” is an act of will , if not an act of faith that is in many ways counterintuitive .
Most Europeans do not perceive Turkey as a “ European Other ” but as a “ non ##AT##-##AT## European Other . ”
Even in Istanbul , the most Westernized of Turkish cities , as soon as one leaves the main arteries , one seems to be immersed in a Middle Eastern or Asian culture .
Israel is not in the European Union , but it , too , is in great danger of losing Turkey .
Far from reinforcing Israel ’ s security , its last two military adventures , in Lebanon and now in Gaza , have caused further self ##AT##-##AT## isolation and loss of world sympathy .
Nowhere has this phenomenon been stronger than in Turkey , where those military escapades have strained the two countries ’ strategic alliance almost to the breaking point .
It is too early to speak of Obama ’ s policy towards Turkey ; suffice it to say that in his willingness to open a respectful dialogue with Islam , he is the only Western leader to move in the right direction .
But can positive American gestures towards Turkey , a key NATO member , be sufficient to offset Israel ’ s insensitive , if not reckless , policies ?
The answer is unclear .
Turkey , too shares some of the responsibility for this mounting process of estrangement . Erdogan ’ s behavior in Davos was , at the very least , irresponsible .
He may have gained popularity back home , but in today ’ s difficult economic times , the temptations of cheap populism are more dangerous than ever .
One does not play lightly with matches next to a pile of dry wood .
WASHINGTON , DC – With America ’ s Republican presidential candidates lining up to declare their fealty to a flat tax – a system of personal ##AT##-##AT## income taxation that assesses a single rate for all – opponents have focused on why it is a bad idea to raise taxes on the poor in order to reduce them for the wealthy .
But , if a flat tax is such a bad idea , why have so many countries embraced it ?
The United States , like other developed countries , does not suffer from any of these conditions ( yet ) , so it is not clear why it needs a flat tax .
The formerly communist countries of Eastern Europe that have adopted a flat tax – including Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Macedonia , Romania , Slovakia , and Ukraine , among others – sorely lack investment capital . &amp; # 160 ; Whether on the European Union ’ s doorstep or just inside , they compete for the attention of foreign direct investors , for whom a flat tax provides an important signal : You are welcome , we will not steal your money , and you can keep what you earn .
For developed countries that already have capital and a track record of inward investment , “ the appeal of the flat tax is consequently less , ” as a report by the International Monetary Fund concludes . &amp; # 160 ; Thus , the flat tax has not been adopted in any developed countries , or in China .
The other countries that have embraced a flat tax are small or micro ##AT##-##AT## states : Jamaica , Tuvalu , Grenada , Mauritius , Timor ##AT##-##AT## Leste , Belize , and Seychelles . &amp; # 160 ; The only ( partial ) exception to this rule is Paraguay , which adopted a flat tax in 2010 .
Here , flat ##AT##-##AT## tax advocates ’ administrative ##AT##-##AT## simplicity arguments have some traction . &amp; # 160 ; If a country is so small that it cannot develop a tax administration effective enough to manage a fair system of progressive taxation , then a flat tax may make sense .
Moreover , some small countries have other sources of revenue , so the benefit of implementing a progressive tax system does not justify the cost .
Tuvalu ’ s government , for example , derives nearly 10 % of its revenues from the sale of rights to its “ .tv ” Internet domain name , which brings in about $ 2 million annually . &amp; # 160 ; Countries that are just slightly larger can afford to collect income taxes in a fairer way .
Finally , if a country ’ s public institutions are in the thrall of oligarchs who are accustomed to stealing with impunity from the public till , a flat tax may be the only way to induce the wealthy to pay any tax at all . &amp; # 160 ; Thus , in 2001 Russia became the first large state to adopt a flat tax , reducing the top marginal rate from 30 % to 13 % . &amp; # 160 ; In 2003 , Ukraine dropped its top rate from 40 % to 13 % .
In nearly all countries that have introduced a flat tax , government revenues from income tax have declined .
That is why its adoption is often associated with an increase in value ##AT##-##AT## added tax rates ( as has occurred throughout Eastern Europe ) .
In the US , the Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain ’ s “ 9 ##AT##-##AT## 9-9 ” plan calls for a 9 % rate for personal and corporate taxes , together with a new 9 % national sales tax .
A country ’ s tax system reflects its institutional capacity , economic circumstances , and distribution of political power .
If the US were to become the first developed country to experiment with a flat tax , that shift would tend to confirm what many suspect but hope is not true : that America is broke , desperate for inward investment , incompetently governed , and increasingly ruled by a self ##AT##-##AT## regarding oligarchic elite .
WARWICK , UK – Nowadays , in country after country , policymakers have become obsessed with the need to strengthen science education .
But what about the humanities – all those disciplines ( literature , history , languages , and so forth ) whose relevance to economic competitiveness is not so obvious ?
We need the humanities only if we are committed to the idea of humanity .
If the humanities have become obsolete , then it may be that humanity is losing its salience .
I do not mean that we are becoming “ less human ” in the sense of “ inhumane . ”
If anything , we live in a time when traditionally human ##AT##-##AT## centered concerns like “ rights ” have been extended to animals , if not nature as a whole .
Rather , the problem is whether there is anything distinctive about being human that makes special demands of higher education .
I believe that the answer continues to be yes .
Today , it sounds old ##AT##-##AT## fashioned to describe the university ’ s purpose as being to “ cultivate ” people , as if it were a glorified finishing school .
However , once we set aside its elitist history , there remains a strong element of truth to this idea , especially when applied to the humanities .
Although we now think of academic disciplines , including the humanities , as being “ research ##AT##-##AT## led , ” this understates the university ’ s historic role in converting the primate Homo sapiens into a creature whose interests , aspirations , and achievements extend beyond successful sexual reproduction .
What was originally called the “ liberal arts ” provided the skills necessary for this transformation .
By submitting to a common regime of speaking , writing , reading , observing , and calculating , the “ upright ape ” acquired the capacity to reason in public .
This enabled first him and then her to command authority regardless of birth , resulting in the forging of networks and even institutions whose benefits cut deeply across bloodlines .
We too easily forget that our heterogeneous societies rely on at least a watered ##AT##-##AT## down version of this training to maintain political and economic order .
The university began with the humanities at its heart , but today it is playing catch ##AT##-##AT## up with the natural sciences .
This is largely because the natural sciences have most closely imitated the productivity measures associated with industry .
The result is a “ bigger is better ” mentality that stresses ever more publications , patents , and citations .
Yet , this agenda tends to be pursued without much concern for how – or if – these measures feed into something of greater social , cultural , and even economic relevance .
The Science Citation Index , originally designed to help researchers discern aggregate trends in increasingly complex subject domains sciences , has helped measure productivity .
But now these trends are routinely converted into norms against which the performance of particular universities , departments , and even individual researchers is judged .
What is most easily measured has become confused with what is most worth measuring .
But , more profoundly , this entire line of thinking neglects the distinctly transformative capacity of the knowledge in which the humanities specializes .
An adequate assessment of this capacity requires looking at its multiplier effects .
As with John Maynard Keynes ’ s notion that returns on public investment must be measured as the long ##AT##-##AT## term consequence of other investments that it stimulates across the economy and society , so , too , with the knowledge generated by the humanities .
This idea is lost in today ’ s cost accounting for universities , which treats what transpires between teacher and student in the classroom as akin to what happens between producer and consumer in the market .
In both cases , it is assumed that the value of the exchanged good is decided shortly after its delivery according to how it satisfies an immediate need .
Not surprisingly , students value their degree by the first job it gets them rather than the life it prepares them for over the next half ##AT##-##AT## century .
Today , it is hard to believe that in the heyday of the welfare state , universities were both more elite and more publicly funded than they are today .
Back then , it was assumed that the benefits of academic training accrued not only , or even primarily , to those who experienced it but also , and more importantly , to the rest of the population , whose lives were variously enriched by the application of the arts and sciences .
Of course , this enrichment included such practical benefits as medical breakthroughs and labor ##AT##-##AT## saving technologies .
But the enrichment provided by the humanities was no less enduring , though its subtler nature makes it harder to track .
Nevertheless , to paraphrase Keynes , every time we turn on the radio or television , read a newspaper , pick up a novel , or watch a movie , we are in the thrall of one or more dead humanists who set the terms of reference through which we see the world .
In its long history as the premier form of academic knowledge , the humanities were frequently criticized for their subversive character .
That some would now question whether the humanities have any impact at all merely reflects the crude and short ##AT##-##AT## sighted way in which the value of academic knowledge is measured and judged today .
Perhaps that befits creatures whose lives are “ solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short , ” to recall Thomas Hobbes ’ description of the state of nature . But it does a grave injustice to those of us who still aspire to full ##AT##-##AT## fledged humanity .
Why are the social sciences so much more at risk of having their budgets cut than the other two great bodies of academic knowledge , the humanities and the natural sciences ?
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher notoriously proposed that the field simply does not exist : there is no such thing as society , she claimed .
Others point to the restructuring of university social science departments .
But the expansion of business schools arguably testifies to the continued vitality of the social sciences .
Nor is it true that the social sciences belabor the obvious , as is sometimes said .
On the contrary , today &apos;s commonplaces were yesterday &apos;s innovations .
If you compare the concepts used to frame newspaper editorials today and ten or more years ago , you will find the deep - but unacknowledged - impact of the social sciences .
The influence may be regretted , but at least it is registered .
Still , where are the social sciences in the vast conversation over &quot; human nature &quot; that has been prompted by recent advances in cognitive neuroscience , behavioral genetics , and evolutionary psychology ?
Check out the elaborate and informative website ( www.edge.org ) devoted to the promotion of a &quot; third culture &quot; that bridges the humanities and the natural sciences .
Social scientists are conspicuous by their absence .
But what difference would their presence make ?
It is often assumed that everyone recoils at the prospect that there are genetic limits to our capacity for change .
Actually , only those imbued with the optimistic spirit of social science recoil .
Everyone else is relieved .
In the &quot; third culture &quot; best seller The Blank Slate : The Modern Denial of Human Nature , Steven Pinker says that we may need to admit a natural scientific basis for what humanists have for centuries called &quot; fate . &quot;
In other words , the configuration of our brains and genes may ultimately be out of our control , however deeply we come to understand them .
Pinker &apos;s message will appeal to those eager to avoid political reforms that would compel a greater sense of collective responsibility .
After all , the social sciences historically offered empirical support and spiritual hope for just such reforms , which are increasingly dismissed as &quot; utopian . &quot;
By contrast , the humanities and the natural sciences share a sense of reality that transcends time and place ; hence their common interest in a fixed &quot; human nature . &quot;
This is tied to a way of thinking and a sense of knowing that is largely contemplative and sometimes even disempowering , as reality comes to seem to be whatever resists our concerted efforts at change .
These two great academic cultures also prefer to study humanity without having to mingle with flesh ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## blood human beings .
Thus , evolutionary psychologists infer what makes us who we are from the remains of our Stone Age ancestors ( including their DNA ) , whereas humanists focus on artifacts of a more recent and literate age .
In contrast , the social sciences adhere to the maxim that the best way to study humans is to interact with them , typically by getting them to do and say things that they might otherwise not .
This profoundly simple idea , common to experiments and ethnographies , inspired the triumphs and disasters that punctuate modern politics .
It requires an increasingly controversial assumption : all human beings - whatever their achievements , competences , status , or health - are equally significant members of society , whose strength ultimately lies in what they can do together .
The social sciences &apos; egalitarianism runs counter to both the humanist fixation on elite &quot; classic &quot; texts and the natural scientific tendency to generalize across species .
Thus , social scientists made the everyday lives of ordinary people respectable , while refusing to privilege certain animals over certain - typically disabled or unwanted - humans .
&quot; Welfare &quot; occupies a pride of place in the social sciences that humanists and natural scientists replace with &quot; survival &quot; and maybe even &quot; fortune . &quot;
To be sure , the checkered history of welfare in the 20 th century put the future of the social sciences in doubt .
But a way forward can be found in T. H. Huxley , Darwin &apos;s fabled public defender .
A late convert to evolution , he was a lifelong skeptic about the theory &apos;s political implications .
For Huxley , civilized society rose above nature by its systematic resistance to natural selection .
In his words , the human condition is not about &quot; survival of the fittest &quot; but &quot; the fitting of as many as can survive . &quot;
Huxley identified humanity &apos;s achievements with legal conventions and medical technologies , artifices that extend human dominion by enabling people to be and do more than they could individually .
The future of the social sciences may lie in rekindling this coalition of law and medicine and upgrading the artificial in a world that may have come to overvalue nature .
Whoever steps into Europe ’ s new top job as President of the European Council will set the mold .
If it is someone of worldwide renown , the presidency will immediately be established as a post of global importance .
But if its first occupant is not a household name , the presidency will be doomed as just another of the European Union ’ s confusing plethora of worthy senior positions that are neither valued nor understood outside Brussels .
The key point here is that Europe won ’ t be able to upgrade the job later .
If the presidency goes to a politician who lacks fame and charisma , its place will forever be low down in the international pecking order .
Of the half ##AT##-##AT## dozen candidates to become “ Europe ’ s President , ” only Tony Blair needs no introduction anywhere .
All the other names in the ring have to be accompanied by a description – the former Finnish this or Austrian that .
Nobody knows whether the current prime ministers of the EU ’ s 27 member countries will choose Blair .
There is considerable lingering ill will over his role in the invasion of Iraq , and there is the inconvenient fact that he is from Euro ##AT##-##AT## skeptic Britain , and that many on the left view him as a leader whose “ third way ” was a betrayal of socialism .
But choosing a president for Europe isn ’ t about Blair the man , or about the political records of any of the others who would like the job .
It is about the job itself .
Europe ’ s problem is that it lacks a clearly identifiable leader . As a result , despite the EU ’ s many successes , it still speaks with too many voices .
This was among the problems that the EU ’ s controversial Lisbon treaty was designed to fix .
It is now in the final stages of its long and difficult birth , and by the New Year should be bringing new mechanisms to bear to streamline European decision ##AT##-##AT## making .
The jewel in its crown is to be the appointment for a 30 ##AT##-##AT## month term of a full ##AT##-##AT## time president of the European Council , which groups the heads of EU member governments , along with a foreign policy chief who will be backed by an embryonic EU diplomatic service .
Now that more than two ##AT##-##AT## thirds of Irish voters have reversed their country ’ s earlier opposition to the Lisbon treaty – with only the Czech Republic ’ s Europhobic president , Václav Klaus , holding out against it – the focus is on who will fill these two jobs .
And that , in turn , has triggered a round of bitter political squabbling that threatens to negate the entire idea of a much more powerful European voice on the global stage .
The three Benelux countries , along with a few other smaller EU nations , are opposed to the new European president being from a large nation .
And there are also those who fear that a political heavyweight in the job might eclipse the EU Commission ’ s President , former Portuguese prime minister José Manuel Barroso , who has just been confirmed for a second five ##AT##-##AT## year term , and devalue the role of the foreign policy chief whose authority Lisbon is due to beef up .
These are specious arguments .
The EU ’ s external relations involve two different types of politics .
The first is the politics of world theatre , where a political figure of global stature could do much to raise the EU ’ s profile and ensure that it has a major say in re ##AT##-##AT## ordering the post ##AT##-##AT## crisis global economic rulebook .
The second is the politics of detail , where the new foreign policy chief ’ s role is to create a single EU stance on the wide range of issues about which European governments still have wildly different national positions .
Europe has an international image problem that in part stems from a complex institutional structure that non ##AT##-##AT## EU countries find baffling .
It is over ##AT##-##AT## represented at G ##AT##-##AT## 20 world summits , for instance , but the presence of four European national leaders , plus EU representatives like Barroso , weakens rather than strengthens its political weight .
The same is true of other global bodies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
The result is that Europe ’ s achievements in recent years – its expansion to create a single economic market of 500 million people and its creation of the euro as a currency that challenges the dollar – are not accompanied by a significantly greater global standing .
World leaders from Barack Obama to Hu Jintao address themselves to Berlin , Paris , and London , rather than to Brussels .
The result is that EU policy proposals that could do much to advance the economic and geopolitical interests of Europeans are not as influential as they could be .
The text of the Lisbon treaty is studiously vague in its job description of the president ’ s role – an approach that prevented trouble for treaty ’ s framers , but merely postponed disagreement .
The real argument now taking place between Europe ’ s national governments is about the authority that the EU ’ s president should have .
The risk is that Europe ’ s squabbling politicians will opt for a figurehead and miss this golden opportunity to create a global leader .
TILBURG , THE NETHERLANDS – Two years ago , the leaders of the world ’ s central banks were considered heroes for their efforts in preventing financial crisis from turning into Great Depression II .
Today , however , central banks are being sharply criticized , and their independence is coming under severe pressure in many countries , particularly in the eurozone , as Mario Draghi , the head of the Bank of Italy , recently pointed out .
The type of person at the helm of any central bank is always important – but now more than ever , because financial crises always threaten central banks ’ independence .
In the United States , the Federal Reserve seems to have support only of the Obama administration , hardly something of which to be proud .
Congress has disparaged the Fed ’ s handling of the crisis , and Representative Ron Paul of Texas , who believes that the Fed ’ s very existence is unconstitutional , will take over one of the key congressional oversight committees in January .
More than half of all Americans want politicians to have more say over monetary policy – a scary prospect in view of the historical record .
Given the likelihood of a long period of sub ##AT##-##AT## par economic growth , increasing pressure on public finances in the eurozone , and the ongoing debate on the future of the euro , the European Central Bank has become , more than ever before , the last line of defense for Europe ’ s common currency .
A firm ECB president , unwilling to yield to political pressure , is needed .
During the financial crisis , the ECB has had an outstanding president in the person of Jean ##AT##-##AT## Claude Trichet .
But his non ##AT##-##AT## renewable term will end in October 2011 , and European leaders are not waiting until the last moment to appoint his successor .
Indeed , positioning and bargaining among the euro ’ s member countries has already started .
First and foremost , the next ECB president should excel on monetary matters .
True , the current financial crisis has brought bank supervision to the fore .
But monetary policy , not bank supervision , is the raison d ’ être of central banks , whereas the banks can be well handled by the newly established European Systemic Risk Board ( ESRB ) , which will be responsible for macro ##AT##-##AT## prudential supervision in Europe from January 1 , 2011 .
Furthermore , and contrary to common belief , the ECB president need not be very diplomatic , but should be able to unite all members of the ECB ’ s Governing Council .
As political pressure on central banks , including the ECB , increases , its president must not hesitate to criticize European politicians and , if necessary , publicly name and shame them .
The ECB ’ s independence is its most valuable asset – indeed , it is indispensible .
A good central banker must be able to say no to politicians .
This does not mean the ECB president should pick fights whenever possible .
On the contrary , he should be able to build support for the ECB ’ s independence .
But he should follow the maxim about politicians set down by the ECB ’ s first president , Wim Duisenberg : “ I can hear them , but I do not listen . ”
The president should also count on support from a majority of Europeans .
Unfortunately , country of origin is highly important in this respect .
Given the fact that the current ECB vice ##AT##-##AT## president is from southern Europe ( Portugal ) , the next head of the ECB must come from northern Europe .
Only someone from Germany , the Netherlands , or a Scandinavian euro country like Finland can count on support from Germans , which is crucial .
There is certainly someone to be found in the eurozone who possesses all these qualities .
In fact , there is more than one .
Draghi is one . Others include Klaus Regling , head of the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) , Axel Weber , President of the Bundesbank , and Jürgen Stark , a current member of the ECB ’ s Executive Board .
Draghi ’ s Italian passport and his past service at Goldman Sachs do not help him much .
Regling has a lot of experience , but none in central banking and monetary policy .
Anyone who wants Stark will need a good team of lawyers to figure out how to convert his current , non ##AT##-##AT## renewable appointment on the Executive Board into an appointment as President without violating the ECB ’ s rules .
Given some of Weber ’ s statements over 2010 , he could be accused of being much too undiplomatic .
Nout Wellink , currently the head of the Dutch central bank , is a wildcard candidate , as is Erkki Liikanen of the Finish central bank .
Both are suitable for the post .
The final decision , of course , rests with European heads of state and government .
But , in our view , Trichet ’ s successor will most likely answer to the name of Weber , Wellink , or Liikanen .
A few months ago , Evo Morales became Bolivia ‘ s first democratically elected indigenous head of state .
Indigenous groups constitute 62 % of Bolivia ’ s population , and those with mixed blood another 30 % , but for 500 years Bolivians had been ruled by colonial powers and their descendants .
Well into the twentieth century , indigenous groups were effectively deprived of a vote and a voice .
Aymara and Quechua , their languages , were not even recognized for conducting public business .
So Morales ’ election was historic , and the excitement in Bolivia is palpable .
But Morales ’ nationalization of Bolivia ’ s oil and gas fields sent shock waves through the international community .
During his campaign , Morales made clear his intention to increase state control over national gas and oil .
But he had made it equally clear that he did not intend to expropriate the property of energy firms – he wanted foreign investors to stay .
( Nationalization does not , of course , necessarily mean expropriation without appropriate compensation . )
Perhaps surprising for modern politicians , Morales took his words seriously .
Genuinely concerned about raising the incomes of his desperately poor people , he recognized that Bolivia needs foreigners ’ expertise to achieve growth , and that this entails paying fairly for their services .
But are foreign owners getting more than a fair rate of return ?
Morales ’ actions are widely supported by Bolivians , who see the so ##AT##-##AT## called privatizations ( or “ capitalizations ” ) under former President Gonzalo “ Goni ” Sanchez de Lozada as a rip ##AT##-##AT## off : Bolivia received only 18 % of the proceeds !
Bolivians wonder why investments of some $ 3 billion should entitle foreign investors to 82 % of the country ’ s vast gas reserves , now estimated to be worth $ 250 billion .
While there has not yet been full disclosure of returns , or an audit of the true value of investments , it appears that investors would , at the old terms , have recouped all their money within just four years .
Bolivians also ask why foreigners reap all the benefits of today ’ s high prices for oil and gas ?
It costs no more to extract oil or gas today than it did when prices were one ##AT##-##AT## third of their current level .
Yet , the foreign oil companies get 82 % of the increase – in the case of oil , this would amount to a windfall for them of $ 32 a barrel or more .
No wonder that Bolivians thought they were being cheated and demanded a new deal .
On May 2 , Morales simply reversed the percentages , pending renegotiation of the contracts : the companies operating in the two largest fields would get 18 % of the production for themselves .
As part of this new deal , Bolivia should also get a larger share when prices increase .
( Bolivia may , of course , not want to bear the risk of a fall in the price , so it may strike a deal to transfer some of the downside risk to foreign companies , giving them in exchange more of the upside potential . )
To most Bolivians , what is at stake is a matter of fairness : Should foreign oil and gas companies get a fair return on their capital , or a supernormal return ?
Should Bolivia be paid a fair value for its resources ?
And should Bolivia , or foreign companies , reap most of the windfall gains from increases in energy prices ?
Moreover , many deals were apparently done in secret by previous governments – and apparently without the approval of Congress .
Indeed , because Bolivia ’ s Constitution requires the approval of Congress for such sales , it isn ’ t clear that Morales is nationalizing anything : the assets were never properly sold .
When a country is robbed of a national art treasure , we don ’ t call its return “ re ##AT##-##AT## nationalization , ” because it belonged to the country all along .
As with many privatizations elsewhere , there are questions as to whether the foreign investors have kept their side of the bargain .
Bolivia contributed to these joint enterprises not only with resources , but also with previous investments .
The foreign companies ’ contribution was supposed to be further investment .
But did they fully live up to their commitments ?
Are accounting gimmicks being used to overstate the true value of foreign capital contributions ?
Bolivia ’ s government has , so far , simply raised questions , and set in motion a process for ascertaining the answer .
The problem in Bolivia is a lack of transparency , both when contracts are signed and afterwards .
Without transparency , it is easy for citizens to feel that they are being cheated – and they often are .
When foreign companies get a deal that is too good to be true , there is often something underhanded going on .
Around the world , oil and gas companies have themselves to blame : too often , they have resisted calls for greater transparency .
In the future , companies and countries should agree on a simple principle : there should be , to paraphrase President Woodrow Wilson ’ s memorable words , “ open contracts , openly and transparently arrived at . ”
If the Bolivians do not get fair value for their country ’ s natural wealth , their prospects are bleak .
Even if they do , they will need assistance , not only to extract their resources , but also to improve the health and education of all Bolivians – to ensure long ##AT##-##AT## term economic growth and social welfare .
For now , the world should celebrate the fact that Bolivia has a democratically elected leader attempting to represent the interests of the poor people of his country .
It is a historic moment .
Fifty years ago , American chicken farmers found that by keeping their birds in sheds they could produce chickens for the table more cheaply and with less work than by traditional farmyard methods .
The new method spread : chickens disappeared from fields into long , windowless sheds .
Factory farming was born .
It isn ’ t called “ factory farming ” merely because those sheds look like factories .
Everything about the production method is geared towards turning live animals into machines for converting grain into meat or eggs at the lowest possible cost .
Walk into such a shed – if the producer will let you – and you will find up to 30,000 chickens .
The National Chicken Council , the trade association for the US chicken industry , recommends a stocking density of 85 square inches per bird – less than a standard sheet of typing paper .
When the chickens approach market weight , they cover the floor completely .
No chicken can move without having to push through other birds .
In the egg industry , hens can barely move at all , because they are crammed into wire cages , which makes it possible to stack them in tiers , one above the other .
Environmentalists point out that this production method is unsustainable .
For a start , it relies on the use of fossil fuel energy to light and ventilate the sheds , and to transport the grain eaten by the chickens .
When this grain , which humans could eat directly , is fed to chickens , they use some of it to create bones and feathers and other body parts that we cannot eat .
So we get less food back than we put into the birds – and less protein , too – while disposing of the concentrated chicken manure causes serious pollution to rivers and ground water .
Animal ##AT##-##AT## welfare advocates protest that crowding the chickens keeps them from forming a natural flock , causes them stress , and , in the case of laying hens , prevents them from even stretching their wings .
The air in the sheds is high in ammonia from bird feces , which are usually allowed to pile up for months – and in some cases for a year or more – before being cleaned out .
Medical experts warn that because the birds are routinely fed antibiotics to keep them growing in such crowded , filthy , and stressful conditions , antibiotic ##AT##-##AT## resistant bacteria could cause a public ##AT##-##AT## health threat .
Yet , despite these well ##AT##-##AT## founded criticisms , over the last 20 years factory farming – not only of chickens , but also of pigs , veal calves , dairy cows , and , in outdoor feedlots , cattle – has spread rapidly in developing countries , especially in Asia .
Now we are discovering that the consequences may be far more deadly than we ever imagined .
As University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown put it after a Canadian outbreak of avian influenza , “ high ##AT##-##AT## intensity chicken rearing is a perfect environment for generating virulent avian flu viruses . ”
Other experts agree .
In October 2005 , a United Nations task force identified as one of the root causes of the bird flu epidemic , “ farming methods which crowd huge numbers of animals into small spaces . ”
Supporters of factory farming often point out that bird flu can be spread by free ##AT##-##AT## range flocks , or by wild ducks and other migrating birds , who may join the free ##AT##-##AT## range birds to feed with them or drop their feces while flying overhead .
But , as Brown has pointed out , viruses found in wild birds are generally not very dangerous .
On the contrary , it is only when these viruses enter a high ##AT##-##AT## density poultry operation that they mutate into something far more virulent .
By contrast , birds that are reared by traditional methods are likely to have greater resistance to disease than the stressed , genetically similar birds kept in intensive confinement systems .
Moreover , factory farms are not biologically secure . They are frequently infested with mice , rats , and other animals that can bring in diseases .
So far , a relatively small number of human beings have died from the current strain of avian influenza , and it appears that they have all been in contact with infected birds .
But if the virus mutates into a form that is transmissible between humans , the number of deaths could run into the hundreds of millions .
Governments are , rightly , taking action to prepare for this threat .
Recently , the US Senate approved spending $ 8 billion to stockpile vaccines and other drugs to help prevent a possible bird flu epidemic .
Other governments have already spent tens of millions on vaccines and other preventive measures .
What is now clear , however , is that such government spending is really a kind of subsidy to the poultry industry .
Like most subsidies , it is bad economics .
Factory farming spread because it seemed to be cheaper than more traditional methods .
In fact , it was cheaper only because it passed some of its costs on to others – for example , to people who lived downstream or downwind from the factory farms , and could no longer enjoy clean water and air .
Now we see that these were only a small part of the total costs .
Factory farming is passing far bigger costs – and risks – on to all of us .
In economic terms , these costs should be “ internalized ” by the factory farmers rather than being shifted onto the rest of us .
That won ’ t be easy to do , but we could make a start by imposing a tax on factory ##AT##-##AT## farm products until enough revenue is raised to pay for the precautions that governments now have to take against avian influenza .
Then we might finally see that chicken from the factory farm really isn ’ t so cheap after all .
No one is indifferent to Al Jazeera , the Qatari ##AT##-##AT## based Arab satellite television station .
You can practically see the blood of US officials boil when they discuss it .
To be sure , in the context of the dream of all Arabs being united and independent of foreign control , Al Jazeera is undeniably partial to Arab aspirations . But that does not make its news reporting untruthful .
In fact , Al Jazeera , which US Secretary of State Colin Powell calls &quot; horrible &quot; and &quot; slanted , &quot; is a pivotal vehicle for reform and change , which genuinely democratic Arab activists and the international community alike have been calling for .
So incensed has America been , however , that it created its own Arabic language mouthpiece in the form of satellite station Al Hurra .
Yet Al Hurra is forbidden from broadcasting within the US , because it is state controlled .
Arabs don &apos;t trust it , either .
It demonstrated its lapdog status by never broadcasting images of prisoners being abused inside Baghdad &apos;s notorious Abu Ghraib prison .
In this respect , at least , Al Hurra fits perfectly within the tame tradition of Arab state broadcasters .
America , however , is not alone in challenging Al Jazeera head on .
The BBC , which briefly ran its own Arabic language news station in the mid ##AT##-##AT## 1990 &apos;s - before closing it down because its Saudi funders were unhappy with its reporting - recently announced that it will re ##AT##-##AT## launch an Arabic language news satellite station .
But instead of bashing or seeking to undermine Al Jazeera , politicians should encourage this bastion of free expression , recognizing that Arabs will need to endure a messy process on the way to democracy .
Along that tortuous route , the world &apos;s major powers are bound to be offended , probably quite regularly .
Television in the Arab world has for years been the mouthpiece used by ruling presidents , kings , and emirs to propagate their official opinions and nothing else .
Elite military units usually protect radio and television stations , because they have often been the first targets in military coups .
Given this history , and the storm of calls for reform in the Arab world , it is a tragic irony that America and the West have paid so little attention to the terrestrial Arab monopoly television channels .
Indeed , US criticism of Al Jazeera sounds more like special pleading because of America &apos;s inept bumbling in Iraq than a genuine desire for free , open , and critical Arab media .
If democracy means giving people a free choice , then there is no doubt that the choice of most Arabs is for a television broadcaster that reflects their aspirations .
In this sense , Al Jazeera is clearly biased , because it is run by Arab patriots and reflects Arab sentiment .
But this is no more a crime than the fact that America &apos;s media reflects American aspirations , and in times of war behaves like a cheerleader for US forces .
The key issue here is whether Al Jazeera , as well as American TV stations , are truthful in what they say .
Al Jazeera is certainly professional .
Its leading journalists are Western ##AT##-##AT## trained , many having worked for years at the BBC .
In fact , Al Jazeera was founded only after the BBC closed its Arabic language station under Saudi pressure .
Al Jazeera &apos;s motto , &quot; opinion and opposing opinion , &quot; has galvanized Arab viewers , because clashing opinions are rarely heard on terrestrial Arab television stations .
Of course , when covering the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the US ##AT##-##AT## led war on Iraq , Al Jazeera has not been objective .
How could it be ?
But it did not make up facts ; it merely reflected majority Arab opinion .
On such fundamental issues of Arab consensus , it is simply illogical to expect an Arab broadcaster to be even ##AT##-##AT## handed .
Moreover , Al Jazeera has not been dumb to complaints about it .
In July , Al Jazeera became the first Arab TV station to create a professional code of ethics .
According to the BBC , the code defines with absolute clarity and transparency how Al ##AT##-##AT## Jazeera journalists are to behave , and sets clear divisions between news , analysis , and commentary .
As for Al Jazeera &apos;s journalistic performance , it is past time that the station be judged by respected professional journalists , not by US or other officials with a policy axe to grind .
A major university department of journalism working with Arab media critics , for example , could provide a much more honest analysis of the station &apos;s work .
If American , British , and other Western officials are serious about reform in the Arab world , they must support reform ##AT##-##AT## minded Arab individuals and organizations , even if those organizations make them uncomfortable at times .
If that becomes the West &apos;s standard , Al Jazeera will rightly be seen as part of the solution , not part of the problem .
COPENHAGEN – Imagine that over the next 70 or 80 years , a giant port city – say , Tokyo – found itself engulfed by sea levels rising as much as 15 feet or more .
Millions of inhabitants would be imperiled , along with trillions of dollars worth of infrastructure .
This awful prospect is exactly the sort of thing global ##AT##-##AT## warming evangelists like Al Gore have in mind when they warn that we must take “ large ##AT##-##AT## scale , preventive measures to protect human civilization as we know it . ”
The rhetoric may sound extreme , but with so much hanging in the balance , surely it ’ s justified .
Without a vast , highly coordinated global effort , how could we possibly cope with sea ##AT##-##AT## level rises on that order of magnitude ?
Well , we already have . In fact , we ’ re doing it right now .
Since 1930 , excessive groundwater withdrawal has caused Tokyo to subside by as much as 15 feet , with some of the lowest parts of the downtown area dropping almost a foot per year in some years .
Similar subsidence has occurred over the past century in a wide range of cities , including Tianjin , Shanghai , Osaka , Bangkok , and Jakarta .
In each case , the city has managed to protect itself from such large sea ##AT##-##AT## level rises and thrive .
The point isn ’ t that we can or should ignore global warming .
The point is that we should be wary of hyperbolic predictions .
More often than not , what sound like horrific changes in climate and geography actually turn out to be manageable – and in some cases even benign .
Consider , for example , the findings of climate scientists Robert J. Nicholls , Richard S.J. Tol , and Athanasios T. Vafeidis .
In research funded by the European Union , they studied what the global economic impact would be if global warming were to result in a collapse of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet .
An event of this magnitude would likely cause the oceans to rise by perhaps 20 feet over the next hundred years – precisely the sort of thing that environmental activists have in mind when they warn about potential end ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## world calamities .
But would it really be all that calamitous ?
Not according to Nicholls , Tol , and Vafeidis .
Here are the facts .
A 20 ##AT##-##AT## foot rise in sea levels ( which , not incidentally , is about ten times more than the United Nations climate panel ’ s worst ##AT##-##AT## case expectations ) would inundate about 16,000 square miles of coastline , where more than 400 million people currently live .
That ’ s a lot of people , to be sure , but hardly all of mankind .
In fact , it amounts to less than 6 % of the world ’ s population – which is to say that 94 % of the population would not be inundated .
And most of those who do live in the flood areas would never even get their feet wet .
That ’ s because the vast majority of those 400 million people reside within cities , where they could be protected relatively easily , as in Tokyo .
As a result , only about 15 million people would have to be relocated .
And that is over the course of a century .
In all , according to Nicholls , Tol , and Vafeidis , the total cost of managing this “ catastrophe ” – if politicians do not dither and pursue smart , coordinated policies – would be about $ 600 billion a year , or less than 1 % of global GDP .
This figure may seem surprisingly low , but that is only because so many of us have accepted the widespread view that we lack the capacity to adapt to large rises in sea levels .
Not only do we have this capacity , but we have demonstrated it many times in the past .
Like it or not , global warming is real , it is man ##AT##-##AT## made , and we need to do something about it .
But we are not facing the end of the world .
Climate science is a subtle and fiendishly convoluted discipline that rarely yields unambiguous forecasts or straightforward prescriptions .
And after 20 years of much talk but precious little action on global warming , a certain amount of frustration is to be expected .
There is an understandable desire to want to cut through the verbiage and shake people by the shoulders .
Unfortunately , trying to scare the socks off of people doesn ’ t help matters .
Yes , a startling statistic , combined with some hyperbolic prose , will make us sit up and pay attention .
But we quickly become desensitized , requiring ever more outrageous scenarios to move us .
As the scare stories become more inflated , so , too , does the likelihood that they will be exposed for the exaggerations that they are – and the public will end up tuning the whole thing out .
This may explain recent polling data showing that public concern about global warming has declined precipitously in the last three years .
In the United States , for example , the Pew Institute reported that the number of Americans who regard global warming as a very serious problem had declined from 44 % in April 2008 to only 35 % last October .
More recently , a BBC study found that only 26 % of Britons believe that man ##AT##-##AT## made “ climate change is happening , ” down from 41 % in November 2009 .
And in Germany , Der Spiegel magazine reported survey results showing that only 42 % feared global warming , compared with 62 % in 2006 .
Fear may be a great motivator in the short term , but it is a terrible basis for making smart decisions about a complicated problem that demands our full intelligence for a long period .
SOFIA – At a time when the ongoing European debt crisis is fracturing public faith in the continent ’ s political and economic institutions , one would expect Europe ’ s leaders to strengthen as many unifying symbols as they can .
Instead , they have allowed one of the jewels of post ##AT##-##AT## World War II European integration – the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) – to come under threat as well .
Unlike the Brussels ##AT##-##AT## based European Union , long beleaguered by its democratic deficit , the Strasbourg ##AT##-##AT## based ECHR is , if anything , too well loved .
In 2011 , more than 60,000 people sought its help – far more than can expect a reasoned decision .
( By contrast , the United States Supreme Court receives roughly 10,000 petitions a year . )
To save the ECHR from this crushing burden , some member states have proposed changes that could weaken it , even if unintentionally .
Those of us who passionately believe in the Court and its achievements must speak out now to persuade the protagonists of misguided reforms to reverse course .
Instead , the ECHR ’ s 47 member states – with 800 million people – need to shoulder more responsibility to make the existing system work .
Launched in the aftermath of the Holocaust , the ECHR has become a potent symbol of Europe ’ s commitment to government by law , not force , by vindicating the rights to life , humane treatment , free expression , and access to a lawyer .
For example , the Court ruled that the infamous “ five techniques ” – an early form of “ enhanced interrogation ” employed by the British in Northern Ireland in the 1970 ’ s – constituted inhuman treatment , and condemned racial segregation of Roma children in Czech schools .
Because of their quality , the ECHR ’ s opinions have a profound impact beyond Europe .
When Strasbourg speaks , the world ’ s judges and lawyers listen .
Even the US Supreme Court cited its reasoning when striking down anti ##AT##-##AT## homosexuality laws in Texas in 2003 .
Nonetheless , the ECHR ’ s future is in serious jeopardy .
As the only impartial check on abuse of power in some countries , the Court is swamped with complaints – more than 60 % come from Russia , Turkey , Italy , Romania , and Ukraine .
Some argue that the answer to the flood of cases is to limit the Court ’ s powers .
But that approach seems unwise .
British Prime Minister David Cameron , for example , has told the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe that national decisions “ should be treated with respect ” – code for less judicial oversight .
Similarly , other senior officials have called for new restrictions on cases that the ECHR may hear , including deferral to those national courts which have supposedly taken full account of European human ##AT##-##AT## rights law .
In the United Kingdom , the Court ’ s 2005 ruling against a blanket withdrawal of voting rights for prisoners , on the grounds that disenfranchisement can be disproportionate to the offense , provoked official wrath .
And , earlier this year , the Cameron government was incensed by a decision that barred the deportation of an Islamic preacher to Jordan on terrorism charges , because his trial there might be tainted by evidence obtained under torture .
Even under new rules , such cases might still come before the Court , because they raise fundamental questions that require interpretation of the European Convention .
Indeed , there is no evidence that proposed Convention amendments aimed at limiting the court ’ s authority would reduce its caseload .
But they send a dangerous message that some governments should be exempt from standards that apply to everyone else .
Reducing the flow of complaints depends , above all , on governments doing more to entrench the rule of law at home – even if they must be pushed and shamed into it .
Authoritative and binding Court judgments , many of which require governments to compensate victims , are among the most effective tools for constructive pressure – and may well provide better value in promoting the rule of law than the millions of euros invested annually in technical assistance and training in the erring states .
In addition , legislative reforms enacted in 2010 must be given time and resources to work .
All agree that the ECHR is making progress in reducing the backlog of pending applications .
More can be done .
The Court can increase the number of “ pilot judgments ” concerning systemic harm , prescribe more specific measures of redress , and stiffen monetary awards where repeated violations reflect persistent failure to heed prior judgments .
The Committee of Ministers , which oversees implementation , should issue public sanctions where appropriate .
And states must take more seriously their obligations to remedy violations before cases reach Strasbourg .
To be sure , no court gets every decision right , or pleases all parties .
But even democratic governments sometimes make big mistakes .
Some political leaders seem too preoccupied with their own disagreements with individual decisions to see the larger interest in preserving a European institution that commands widespread admiration .
The next two months will be telling .
The UK , which currently holds the rotating Council of Europe Chair , has announced that it will seek adoption by April of a ministerial declaration on Court reform .
Though a draft is now circulating in national capitals , the role of civil ##AT##-##AT## society groups remains unclear .
It is crucial that those who have the greatest stake in the ECHR – Europe ’ s people – participate meaningfully in these discussions .
In a time of financial constraint , the Court ’ s judges issue more than 1,000 rulings annually , many of great importance , for less than the cost of the EU ’ s publications budget .
A half ##AT##-##AT## century after its birth , the ECHR provides an invaluable public good , not just for Europeans , but for all people concerned with human rights anywhere .
In the coming weeks , Europe ’ s governments will be measured by their commitment to the preservation of this vital global resource .
If the late great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today , he no doubt would wonder whether the world had turned upside down .
His hugely influential “ dependency ” theory argued that if poor countries relied too much on commodity exports , they would never achieve the industrial depth needed to sustain rapid growth .
Instead , they would become mired in a cycle of declining global commodity prices and ever ##AT##-##AT## dwindling income shares .
Prebisch ’ s preferred policy response , protectionism , proved disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that heeded him .
But the fact is that for many years , Prebisch seemed to have made the right call on long ##AT##-##AT## term commodity price trends .
Relentless efficiency gains in agriculture and resource extraction pushed down prices for commodities , especially during the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s .
With few exceptions , countries that focused on commodity exports performed dismally , whereas many resource ##AT##-##AT## poor Asian countries raced ahead .
Today , however , with Asia ’ s giants , India and China , joining the global economy , prices for oil , gold , wheat , and virtually every other commodity are exploding .
While there will always be cycles – oil prices , for example , will probably fall before they start rising again – the long ##AT##-##AT## run trend for many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time to come .
What many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to have recognized yet , though Prebisch would have realized it instantly , is that this dramatic turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of power .
Indeed , perhaps no other aspect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades .
The questions are many .
Are today ’ s rich countries prepared for an era of co ##AT##-##AT## dependency , in which they are just as desperate for commodities as developing countries are for industrial imports and technology ?
Are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to commodity producers as they become much wealthier ?
How will the world ’ s two superpowers , China and the United States , come to terms with the fact that important commodity ##AT##-##AT## exporting regions from Africa to the Middle East to Central Asia are littered with ill ##AT##-##AT## formed nation states ?
Some self ##AT##-##AT## anointed seers portray the problem as being one of finite natural resources , with the world running out of critical commodities at an alarming rate .
Nowadays , there are many adherents of the “ Hubbert ’ s peak ” theory of oil production , which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity , the wells are running dry , and it is all downhill from here .
However , as leading oil historian Dan Yergin points out , prophets of doom have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times already .
Each time , radical improvements in technology made the threat evaporate .
In the late 1800 ’ s , oil extraction involved dredging with a mule .
Today , no one thinks anything of drilling 3,000 meters beneath the ocean floor .
There have been similar improvements across the board in metals mining and agriculture .
No , the world is not about to run out of commodities .
Instead , what is happening is that the integration of 2.5 billion people ( China and India alone ) into the global economy is producing a demand shift that is likely to put far more upward pressure on commodity prices than any technology gains are likely to offset .
So , for at least the next 50 to 75 years , and perhaps until humans start mining on Mars sometime in the coming centuries , prices for many natural resources are headed up .
Will the rebalancing of global economic power that results from this destabilize world politics ?
World War I , of course , was partly set off by Germany ’ s concern that the other colonial powers had locked up too large a share of world oil and commodity supplies .
Similarly , in World War II , Japan feared for the stability of its foreign supplies of oil and other natural resources .
Will similar tensions arise between resource ##AT##-##AT## challenged China ( where even water scarcity is a problem ) and the West ?
Fortunately , this does not seem likely for the moment , especially given the Chinese leadership ’ s sober and pragmatic approach to its resource problems .
The Chinese are looking to regions like Africa , hoping to find stable trading partners .
They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans , who don ’ t just want to trade with commodity exporters , but to convert them as well .
Then there are those American leaders who still speak of making the US self ##AT##-##AT## sufficient in energy supplies .
But this is basically a joke : self ##AT##-##AT## indulgent , maybe , but self ##AT##-##AT## sufficient , never .
Much of the Arab world understandably views the invasion of Iraq as the cornerstone of the real US strategy for securing stable energy supplies .
If they are right , one can only hope that America has a plan B.
Meanwhile , commodity prices will continue to rise , with oil exporters now constituting the largest contributors to America ’ s gaping trade deficit .
Maybe the real US strategy is to try to owe the commodity ##AT##-##AT## exporting countries so much money that they will feel dependent on making America happy !
That is one twist that Prebisch would never have anticipated .
Forty years ago , Charles de Gaulle said &quot; Non &quot; to Britain &apos;s request to join the European Community .
By June 9 , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown will offer his own &quot; No &quot; to Europe .
But Britain &apos;s decision whether to join the single European currency , the Euro , was taken long ago , and it was always going to be some version of &quot; No . &quot;
When France first invited Britain to join the infant European enterprise , a decade before General de Gaulle barred the door , the supercilious mandarins in Britain &apos;s Treasury ensured that Britain would indignantly reject the offer .
Treasury bureaucrats have remained predictably anti ##AT##-##AT## European ever since .
Like the courtiers who surrounded Louis XVIII , they have forgotten nothing and learned nothing .
The only question now in doubt is whether Brown &apos;s verdict on the Euro will be &quot; Not quite yet , &quot; &quot; Not before the next election , &quot; or just plain &quot; No . &quot;
It is a decision being taken virtually independently of Prime Minister Tony Blair , and even against his wishes .
Blair believes that Britain ought to join the Euro , because he wants Britain to be , as he puts it , &quot; at the heart of Europe &quot; .
Most commentators tended to assume that , if that &apos;s what Tony Blair wants , then sooner or later that is what will happen , because , after all , he is the Prime Minister .
The flaw in this reasoning is that Blair surrendered control of the single currency decision to the Treasury early in his first term , and he has never had the courage or political strength to take it back .
It is sometimes said that Tony Blair is instinctively European ( though that is said less often since the Iraq war ) .
But when he came to power , in 1997 , he was not able or willing to face down Britain &apos;s traditional anti ##AT##-##AT## Europeanism ; in particular , he was not prepared to commit his government to eventual Euro membership .
Blair &apos;s solution to his Euro dilemma was to pretend that adopting the Euro was not a major political decision , but a technical question , to be decided on &quot; purely &quot; economic grounds .
So , in October 1997 , Gordon Brown announced that he had devised five tests to see whether Britain and the Euro were suited to each other .
In due course , the Treasury would reach a judgment that would be technically expert , economically impartial , and politically neutral .
If Tony Blair ever believed any of this , he was a fool .
Brown claimed that his five tests would produce answers that were plain and unambiguous .
Yet , because they were all questions about the future , they would inevitably be based entirely on speculation .
Where Gordon Brown himself really stands on the issue is unclear , because he is a deeply secretive man .
Many believe that his primary concern in the Euro debate is over how it affects his power vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis Blair .
In any event , once the decision of principle had been subordinated to ostensibly technical economic tests , it was unavoidable that Treasury mandarins , who are institutionally opposed to European integration , would conduct them .
So the verdict was always going to be &quot; No , &quot; which is why the only freedom of movement for Blair and Brown was going to be &quot; Not yet . &quot;
Of course , there is not and cannot be an overpowering economic case for joining the Euro , at any time .
Imagine that the British government decides one day to go for Euro membership , and to put the issue to the test of a referendum .
At the moment , the electorate is hostile to Euro membership by a large margin ; if the government is to persuade the voters to change their minds on purely economic grounds , it must deploy a powerful case .
Voters will not be impressed by the Treasury &apos;s mumbo ##AT##-##AT## jumbo ; they will need strong , simple arguments that Britain will be better off by joining .
If the British economy and the Euro ##AT##-##AT## zone economy are both doing well , the economic case for British membership is obviously weak .
The same is true if the British economy and the Euro ##AT##-##AT## zone economy are both doing badly .
If the British economy is doing well and the Euro ##AT##-##AT## zone economy is doing badly , there is no economic case whatsoever for British membership .
That is the current situation .
The only scenario in which there could be a strong , purely economic case for Euro membership is one in which the Euro ##AT##-##AT## zone is doing very well , the British economy is doing very badly , and membership looks like the best way to deliver long ##AT##-##AT## term recovery .
But if the British economy were doing very badly , the other member states might snub Britain .
Obviously , &quot; doing well &quot; and &quot; doing badly &quot; are clumsy notions ; but we are talking about a referendum , not about higher mathematics .
A referendum on joining the Euro probably cannot be won unless a British government is willing to say three things : first , that it favors closer EU political integration ; second , that the single currency is but one expression of that integration , and third , that it is committed to Euro membership .
Curiously , many voters who oppose Euro membership nonetheless believe that it will happen .
No doubt they would prefer the government to tell them the truth first .
MOSCOW – Germany ’ s ex ##AT##-##AT## Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is a legend in Russia .
He serves Gazprom ’ s interests for a measly couple of million euros a year , sits in at sessions of the Russian Academy of Sciences , and writes books about his staunch friendship with “ Genosse Wladimir , ” who , in the not ##AT##-##AT## so ##AT##-##AT## distant past , earned himself the well ##AT##-##AT## deserved nickname of “ Stasi ” among business circles in gangster ##AT##-##AT## ridden St. Petersburg .
But it is not immediately obvious whether it is Schroeder licking Putin ’ s boots nowadays or vice versa .
The two of them are building , or trying to build , the Nord Stream gas pipeline , an exceptionally costly project that satisfies twin strategic objectives .
Demonstratively hostile to the interests of both Belarus and Ukraine , the pipeline is intended to ensure that these countries are under Russia ’ s energy thumb , regardless of who is in power in Minsk and Kiev .
As a bonus , the pipeline will also consolidate the Russian economy ’ s status as an appendage of Germany ’ s – its supplier of natural resources .
Certain of Schroeder ’ s predecessors as German chancellor sought to attain the same objective by rather different means .
The Kremlin ’ s achievements in securing the help of Americans willing to offer their influence are equally impressive .
Indeed , the Obama administration ’ s Russia policy is being nurtured with advice from people who have no official position in the administration but close business ties to Russia and the Kremlin : Henry Kissinger , James A. Baker , Thomas Graham , and Dimitri Simes .
The first two are major geo ##AT##-##AT## politicians ; Graham and Simes are respected as outstanding Russia specialists .
They write key reports for the administration , and shuttle between Moscow and Washington , coordinating the parameters of the Obama administration ’ s effort to “ reset ” the bilateral relationship .
Like Schroeder , all these people are not economically disinterested .
Baker is a consultant for the two companies at the commanding heights of the Russian economy , Gazprom and Rosneft .
The Kissinger Associates lobbying group , whose Russian section is headed by Graham , feeds in to the Kissinger ##AT##-##AT## Primakov working group , a quasi ##AT##-##AT## private ##AT##-##AT## sector effort , blessed by Putin , to deepen ties between Russia and the United States .
It is highly instructive to read the recommendations of these people and groups , as they unobtrusively render the objectives of their Kremlin clients into a language familiar to American leaders .
Graham ’ s latest contribution , “ Resurgent Russia and US Purposes , ” is most revealing in this respect .
The author finds the government of a “ Russia getting up off its knees ” to consist of progressive modernizers fully aware of the challenges facing their country as it attempts to “ return to the great powers club . ”
“ In order to become a genuinely developed and modern country , ” Graham continues , “ in the coming decade Russia will need to invest at least one trillion dollars in modernizing its infrastructure .
America and the West in general have a vital interest in seeing the modernization of Russia succeed .
The lion &apos;s share of the technologies , know ##AT##-##AT## how , and a substantial proportion of the investment , needs to come from Europe and the USA . ”
In addition to the technology and investments , Graham quietly slips in a foreign policy suggestion for the Obama administration that is sure to please the Kremlin : “ Finlandizing ” Ukraine .
Unless that sort of appeasement is pursued , he warns , Russia will continue to oppose the US “ wherever and whenever it can . ” According to Graham , “ At the extreme , a weak Russia , with its vast resources and sparse population east of the Urals , could become the object of competition among the great powers , notably China and the United States . ”
That unspoken help ##AT##-##AT## us ##AT##-##AT## develop ##AT##-##AT## or ##AT##-##AT## we ’ ll ##AT##-##AT## let ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## Chinese ##AT##-##AT## do ##AT##-##AT## it threat is a logical development of Prime Minister Putin ’ s homily at this year ’ s World Economic Forum in Davos , where he advocated decisive action to end the world economic crisis .
His recipe ?
Western countries should write off half a trillion dollars ’ worth of debt owed to them by the Russian state corporations run by his pals from the Dresden KGB and the Ozero dacha cooperative .
But no amount of money will succeed in modernizing Putin &apos;s kleptocratic regime , which has already squandered trillions in oil wealth .
Simply put , the Putin system is politically , institutionally , and intellectually antithetical to the task of modernization .
Graham ’ s only error in his presentation is his attempt to frighten the administration with a hypothetical confrontation between the US and China over Russian resources .
This is not his area of specialization .
Kissinger works personally with the Chinese account , jointly propounding with his long ##AT##-##AT## time rival Zbigniew Brzezinski the notion , so seductive for an America growing weary of its imperial burden , of a global Big Two .
Here is a recent sample of Kissinger ’ s geopolitical arts : “ The role of China in a new world order is crucial .
A relationship that started on both sides as essentially a strategic design to constrain a common adversary has evolved over the decades into a pillar of the international system ... The Sino ##AT##-##AT## American relationship needs to be taken to a new level .
This generation of leaders has the opportunity to shape relations into a design for a common destiny , much as was done with trans ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic relations in the post ##AT##-##AT## war period . ”
No doubt Kissinger believes every word he wrote , but his ideas also honestly articulate the aspirations of his customers .
It ’ s just that not all customers have the same motives .
One wants to get his hooks into a further trillion dollars that it can pick away at , while the other wants to become “ a central construct of the system of international relations . ”
But , in both cases , the customers are getting the influence for which they are paying .
The list of urgent challenges facing humanity is depressingly long .
AIDS , hunger , armed conflict , and global warming compete for attention alongside government failure , malaria , and the latest natural disaster .
While our compassion is great , our resources are limited .
So who should be helped first ?
To some , making such priorities seems obscene .
But the United Nations and national governments spend billions of dollars each year trying to help those in need without explicitly considering whether they are achieving the most that they can .
The western media focuses on a tsunami in Asia ; donations flow freely .
An earthquake that devastates Pakistan garners fewer headlines , so the developed world gives a lot less .
There is a better way .
We could prioritize our spending to achieve the greatest benefit for our money .
This month , I will ask UN ambassadors how they would spend $ 50 billion to reduce suffering .
They will repeat the same exercise that some of the world ’ s best economists tackled in a 2004 project called the “ Copenhagen Consensus ” : weighing up solutions to the great challenges facing the world , and deciding what should be done first .
But the question shouldn ’ t be left to politicians or Nobel laureates alone .
We must all engage in the debate .
One hopes that this task has been made slightly simpler by the publication of a book in which the Copenhagen Consensus economists boil down their insights .
Here ’ s one fact to consider : the entire death toll from the Southeast Asian tsunami is matched each month by the number of worldwide casualties of HIV / AIDS .
A comprehensive prevention program providing free or cheap condoms and information about safe sex to the regions worst affected by HIV / AIDS would cost $ 27 billion and save more than 28 million lives .
This , say the economists who took part in the Copenhagen Consensus , makes it the single best investment that the world could possibly make .
The social benefits would outweigh the costs by 40 to one .
Other options that the economists favored spending some of their $ 50 billion include providing micro ##AT##-##AT## nutrients to the world ’ s hungry , establishing free trade , and battling malaria with mosquito nets and medication .
At the other end of the scale , responses to climate change like the Kyoto Protocol would cost more than they would achieve , so the economists crossed them off the list of things to do right now .
Regardless of whether we agree with the economists , everybody must admit that we cannot do everything at once .
Discussing our priorities is crucial .
Often , politicians avoid prioritization .
Why ?
The glib answer is because it is hard .
There are many interested parties .
No group wants their solution to come last , and no government wants its country ’ s national challenges to be overlooked .
The UN conference won ’ t be easy .
But it shows that there is a will to put prioritization squarely at the center of attention .
It will produce a “ to do ” list that will demonstrate how to achieve the most that we can for humanity , which could lead , in turn , to more transparent decision ##AT##-##AT## making .
The principles of economics provide a sound basis on which to make rational choices .
Now , the discussion needs to shift from the academic sphere to political life .
It ’ s time for all of us to consider and compare our own priority lists .
We must endeavor to shorten the list of challenges facing humanity .
But that requires all of us to engage in a debate about what we need to do first .
WASHINGTON , DC – Robert Zoellick will depart in June as President of the World Bank , once again raising the thorny issue of leadership of the Bretton Woods twins ( the Bank and the International Monetary Fund ) .
At their birth , John Maynard Keynes memorably warned that if these institutions did not get good leaders they would “ fall into an eternal slumber , never to waken or be heard of again in the courts and markets of Mankind . ”
Getting a good leader , of course , requires a careful selection process .
Today , however , the world is stuck with just the opposite : a dreadfully antiquated process whereby the United States and Europe , despite their economic travails , retain a monopoly on the leadership of the Bank and the IMF , respectively .
There is grudging agreement that this system should change . But the forces perpetuating the status quo – European and American resistance to change and emerging ##AT##-##AT## market countries ’ passivity – remain powerful , as the choice last year of Christine Lagarde to lead the IMF illustrated .
Election ##AT##-##AT## year politics in the US will strengthen these forces further , with President Barack Obama ’ s administration unlikely to relinquish a symbol of global power , which would invite opponents ’ charges of weak leadership .
But , in some ways , the easy part is to state the case for the obvious : the Bank requires a new selection process that will enable it to choose the most qualified person , regardless of nationality .
The more difficult part is to identify the qualifications needed to run the Bank at a time when its role must be adapted to far ##AT##-##AT## reaching global changes .
For the first time in a long time , a significant number of poor countries are catching up to the advanced economies , and the list of development successes is lengthening .
That means that more of the poorest countries will therefore graduate out of the need for concessional lending from the Bank .
The Bank ’ s non ##AT##-##AT## concessional lending agency , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , may well retain its rationale , especially because three ##AT##-##AT## fourths of the world ’ s poor now reside in middle ##AT##-##AT## income countries .
But easier access to private finance will force a re ##AT##-##AT## evaluation of the IBRD ’ s methods and the magnitude of its lending .
For example , countries may want the Bank to continue to provide neutral advice and set standards on procurement and quality , but without the high transactions costs that have become the hallmark of Bank finance .
At the same time , many of the development challenges in the foreseeable future – climate change , low agricultural productivity , growing water scarcity – &amp; nbsp ; are increasingly global in nature .
Looking ahead , the Bank will have to shift from lending to governments towards financing the provision of global public goods .
A more successful developing world also poses an intellectual challenge to the Bank as a custodian of research and policy thinking in the field of development economics .
The Bank , which has drawn predominantly upon US ##AT##-##AT## based centers of learning , can no longer ply a single model or dictate from a universal template .
To be fair , the Bank has embraced the message of eclecticism , but a new leader will have to go further , paying greater attention to the specific contexts and demands of individual borrowers and learning from a wider set of successful development experiences .
The Bank ’ s major shareholders also face a stark choice .
If they believe that the Bank has a meaningful future worth supporting , it is the rapidly growing emerging ##AT##-##AT## market countries , not the indebted West , that can provide the resources ( this means China , of course , but even Brazil and India have growing aid programs ) .
In return , they will rightly demand a greater voice in running the Bank , especially if the Bank ’ s focus shifts towards global public goods .
But if the status quo powers are unwilling to cede control , the system of official international financing established by Bretton Woods will become increasingly fragmented .
Countries like China will be reinforced in their belief that going it alone is the best option , with adverse consequences for multilateralism .
These dramatic shifts and daunting challenges mean that the World Bank ’ s next president will have to be someone whose primary task is to initiate and sustain change while commanding support and legitimacy across the Bank ’ s membership .
He or she will also require a demonstrated capacity for political leadership and a core conviction that the Bank needs a new vision and path forward .
It is imperative that the selection process be altered to broaden the search for candidates who are sensitive to changing realities and possess key qualifications .
This would not mean ruling out a deserving American candidate such as Hillary Clinton , but it would also mean looking carefully at others , such as former Presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico ; Ngozi Okonjo ##AT##-##AT## Iweala , the economics czarina in Nigeria ; Mo Ibrahim , an exemplar of African business success ; Nandan Nilekani , the Indian software mogul ##AT##-##AT## turned ##AT##-##AT## development ##AT##-##AT## official ; and Andrew Sheng of Malaysia , a distinguished former financial regulator .
The current selection procedure is losing legitimacy in a changing world , and it carries greater risks of a bad outcome : an unsuitable candidate .
The consequences of retaining it might not be as dramatic as Keynes ’ prophesied , but there is a real possibility that the Bank will ossify into an institution whose increasingly impoverished G ##AT##-##AT## 7 donors dispense progressively smaller sums of money in the same questionable ways to a shrinking number of supplicants .
NEW HAVEN – Central bankers around the world failed to see the current financial crisis coming before its beginnings in 2007 .
Martin Čihák of the International Monetary Fund reported in July 2007 that , of 47 central banks found to publish financial stability reports ( FSRs ) , “ virtually all ” gave a “ positive overall assessment of their domestic financial system ” in their most recent reports .
And yet , although these central banks failed us before the crisis , they should still play the lead role in preventing the next crisis .
That is the conclusion , perhaps counterintuitive , that the Squam Lake Group &#91; http : / / squamlakegroup.org / &#93; , a think tank of 15 academic financial economists to which I belong , reached in our recently published report , Fixing the Financial System .
Macro ##AT##-##AT## prudential regulators ( government officials who focus not on the soundness of individual financial institutions , but rather on the stability of the whole financial system ) are sorely needed , and central bankers are the logical people to fill this role .
Other regulators did no better in predicting this crisis , and are even less suited to prevent the next .
David Cameron ’ s new government in the United Kingdom apparently came to the same conclusion when it announced plans to transfer regulatory authority from the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) to the Bank of England .
But agreement about the regulatory role of central banks is not widely spread .
In the United States , for example , there is recognition of the importance of macro ##AT##-##AT## prudential regulation , but not of giving this authority to the Federal Reserve .
The newly passed US financial ##AT##-##AT## reform legislation entrusts macro ##AT##-##AT## prudential policy to a new Financial Stability Oversight Council .
That is good , but the US Treasury secretary will be the council ’ s chairman , and the Fed , despite gaining some new powers , will for the most part be only one of many members .
The head of the council is thus a political appointee who serves at the pleasure of the president .
Recent history shows that political appointees often fail to take courageous or unpopular steps to stabilize the economy .
A modern US president certainly remembers how difficult it was to convince voters to put him where he is , and is perpetually campaigning to maintain approval ratings and to preserve his party ’ s prospects in the next election .
The Treasury secretary is part of the president ’ s team , and works next door to the White House .
George W. Bush won the 2000 election , despite losing the popular vote .
In 2003 , Bush chose as his Treasury secretary John W. Snow , a railroad president who , as Barron ’ s columnist Alan Abelson put it , “ may not be the sharpest knife in the cabinet . ” Snow obliged the president and gave unquestioning support to his policies until leaving office in 2006 , just before the crisis erupted .
Under the new law , Snow would have been in charge of the stability of the entire US economy .
One theme that Bush found resonated with voters in his 2004 re ##AT##-##AT## election campaign was that of the “ ownership society . ”
A successful economy , Bush argued , requires that people learn to take responsibility for their actions , and policies aimed at boosting home ownership would inculcate this virtue on a broader scale .
That sounded right to voters , especially if it meant government policies that encouraged the emerging real ##AT##-##AT## estate bubble and made their investments in homes soar in value .
Snow echoed his boss . “ The American economy is coiled like a spring and ready to go , ” he chirped in 2003 .
Two years later , near the very height of the bubbles in the equity and housing markets , he declared that , “ We can be pleased that the economy is on a good and sustainable path . ”
But , to Bush ’ s credit , he also brought in Ben Bernanke in 2006 as Fed Chairman .
Not part of Bush ’ s team , Bernanke was protected from political pressures by America ’ s long tradition of respect for the Fed ’ s independence .
The choice of Bernanke , an accomplished scholar , apparently reflected Bush ’ s acceptance of the public ’ s expectation of a first ##AT##-##AT## rate appointee .
The same problems occur in many other countries .
People who are chosen in part to win the next election often find their economic judgment constrained .
A news story in 2003 reported , for example , that Australian Secretary to the Treasury Ken Henry had warned of a “ housing bubble ” there , but then quickly tried to withdraw his comment , saying that it was “ not for quotation outside of this room . ” He did earlier this year finally propose new tax policy to slow the still ##AT##-##AT## continuing Australian housing bubble , but now he can ’ t get his government to implement it .
By contrast , in recent decades central bankers in many countries have gradually won acceptance for the principle of independence from day ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## day political pressures .
The public in much of the world now understands that central bankers will be allowed to do their work without interference from politicians .
There is a tradition of the central banker as a worldly philosopher , who stands up for long ##AT##-##AT## term sensible policy , and this tradition makes it politically easier for central bankers to do the right thing .
In fact , while the world ’ s central banks did not see the current crisis coming and did not take steps before 2007 to relieve the pressures that led to it , they did react decisively and energetically as the crisis unfolded , with coordinated international action .
This was facilitated by the tradition of political independence and cooperation that has developed over the years among central bankers .
The crisis has underscored the utmost importance of macro ##AT##-##AT## prudential regulation .
Although our central bankers are not perfect judges of financial stability , they are still the people who are in the best political and institutional position to ensure it .
PRAGUE : Identity and sovereignty are often discussed nowadays .
But what do they actually mean ?
Both probably consist of feelings that a community can only be its true self when it can be so without hindrance – in essence , when a community can decide its own fate .
Today ’ s talk about identity and sovereignty is often rather gloomy .
Both are allegedly endangered : by an EU that wishes to assimilate “ us ” as much as possible ; by the European Commission with its standards ; by NATO , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank ; by the United Nations ; by foreign capital ; by Western ideologies ; by Eastern mafias ; by American influence ; by Asian or African immigration ; and by God knows what else .
Some of these concerns may contain a rational core .
Yet they all derive from a traditional misconception – the belief that upholding character , identity or sovereignty is not principally the task of a community or a people but is something left in the control of others ; that is , left to those who would attempt to deprive “ us ” of our identity , or at least to weaken it .
I do not think , however , that the world ’ s main concern is to find ways to rob people of their identity and sovereignty .
Respect for any nation ’ s unique character ; the manner of its development ; and , the degree to which a community decides its fate , is determined primarily by those living within it .
How is this fate determined ?
It depends on whether a people close themselves off in hope that the various winds of this world will pass them by ; or , whether a nation takes the opposite tack and conducts itself as true inhabitants of this continent and of this planet , that is , as people engaged with the world and who assume their share of responsibility for it .
All humanity is faced by this crucial dilemma : to silently watch a suicidal self ##AT##-##AT## propulsion of our civilization ; or to become active participants in the maintenance of global public assets , including the most precious one of all – our planet and its biosphere – of which we are a part .
But the concept of community is also composed of concrete things .
It depends , for example , on whether the environment is nurtured .
It depends on whether a people let their cities and towns become marred by a banal universal architecture devoid of creativity and imagination .
Such blights are not imposed by the European Union or by global capital with its transnational corporations , or by evil foreigners .
All of this physical degradation – as it happens – is accomplished with local consent and active local assistance .
In other words : those who defile “ our ” identity are primarily ourselves – we who should be its protectors and guardians .
Who is it that infests language and conversation with cliches , ill ##AT##-##AT## structured syntax and rote expressions that flow mindlessly from mouth to mouth and pen to pen ?
Who is responsible for the sterile language of commercials seen on every wall and television , indeed , seen everywhere , and without which we appear to be unable to know even the time of day ?
Aren ’ t these severe attacks on language also assaults on a root of our identities ?
And aren ’ t we who use them , quite willingly , also responsible for them ?
Let us go farther : Who allows young people to bathe from morning till night in blood flowing on television and movie screens , and yet are sanctimonious and astonished about the aggressiveness of the young ?
Who reads all kinds of trash and porno ##AT##-##AT## trash ?
These “ entertainments ” are not filmed and published by bureaucrats from Brussels or by representatives of international institutions , foreign states or large international corporations : they are marketed by citizens to fellow citizens .
Behind these visible assaults on identity found in every industrial country , the postcommunist countries confront other serious threats to both sovereignty and identity .
Over the past ten years of economic transformation , unimaginable wealth has unaccountably disappeared from banks and companies ; billions in taxes go unpaid .
Few of those responsible have been brought to justice .
Perhaps worst of all , those who transferred money to tax havens seem to enjoy the silent admiration of the people of whom they have taken advantage .
But who , precisely , are those who do not repay their debts , and who are those who hire assassins to get rid of their creditors ?
Who , among those who should be serving as models for others , that is , who among the leaders of political parties , denies his own financial machinations with a smirk ?
Who emits into our political and public life the poisons of dissension , foul play , egoism , hatred and envy ?
Who – quite inconspicuously – is leading us to become ever more hardened in our sensibilities and toward becoming increasingly accustomed to the fact that everyone can lie about everything and anything ?
I repeat : if a nation &apos;s identity is jeopardized , it is placed in that position primarily from within ; it is placed in jeopardy by choice – often the choices expressed at the ballot box – and out of negligence or indolence .
Threats to identity nowadays are primarily not matters of dictates from outside .
True , the blind pursuit of profit is not the invention of any one people .
True , that pursuit is a trait which is immensely contagious .
But it is also true that nobody can force anyone to take that course .
If we really want it , if we all are prepared to express the desire to preserve community and identity by taking part in elections and by making the right choices , an open international environment and the advanced democratic cultures of our neighbors , friends and allies constitutes the best ground for advancing a people ’ s uniqueness .
Nowadays , any identity can truly live and flourish only if it breathes the free air of the world ; if it defines itself against a background of lasting and living neighborly relations with other identities ; and , if it confronts , in a dignified manner , both the adverse winds that blow across today ’ s world and , perhaps more importantly , the adverse desires that come from within .
TOLEDO , Spain – Does the war in the Caucasus herald the coming of Cold War II ?
Or is it a Russian invitation to the West to reshape the global status quo that has prevailed since the end of Cold War I ?
Russia ’ s military is certainly not fit for a global confrontation with the West .
Not only did Russian intelligence fail to catch the coming Georgian attack on South Ossetia , but Russia ’ s electronic warfare system and ill ##AT##-##AT## equipped ground troops looked like outdated Soviet ##AT##-##AT## era relics .
Then again , a war does not have to display state ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## art weaponry to convey a powerful political message .
After all , America ’ s global leverage is dwindling even as its army remains the most sophisticated military machine in history .
By showing that the United States has lost its monopoly on the unilateral use of force , and by invading an American ally – which even the Soviet Union never dared – Russia blatantly challenged the Pax Americana that emerged from the US victory in the Cold War .
The war in Georgia could not have happened if America had not mishandled its global hegemony so disastrously .
The US entered a calamitous war in Iraq , missed more than one opportunity to engage Iran &apos;s revolutionary regime , pushed for unending expansion of NATO onto the doorstep of Russia , and haughtily ignored Russia ’ s protests against the deployment of missile defenses in Eastern Europe .
Under the cover of the “ war on terror , ” the US played into Russia ’ s fear of encirclement through its military penetration into Central Asian countries such as Afghanistan , Pakistan , Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , and Tajikistan .
In its quest to counter what it sees as a hostile US strategy of creating American “ Cubas ” on its doorstep , the Kremlin is promoting alliances with Raúl Castro ’ s Cuba and Hugo Chávez ’ s Venezuela .
In the Middle East , Russia is doing everything to regain some of the footholds it had in the past with the aim of sidelining America as the sole global actor in the region .
Syrian President Bashar al ##AT##-##AT## Assad ’ s recent visit to Moscow is a transparent manifestation of the potential for a renewed alliance .
Russia continues to place hurdles before American proposals for sanctions on Iran , has signed with it lavish energy contracts , and is about to sell it advanced aerial systems aimed at thwarting a possible Israeli or American attack .
Likewise , the Russians have just erased much of Iraq ’ s debt and agreed lucrative oil drilling deals .
One victim of American post ##AT##-##AT## Cold War unilateralism has been the transatlantic alliance .
The US drive to expand NATO is not shared by all its allies , and Europe is in no mood to follow in the footsteps of Georgia ’ s impulsive president and be dragged by the ex ##AT##-##AT## Soviet Baltic states and Poland into a confrontation with Russia .
Europe , dependent as it is on Russian energy supplies , is not prepared for a new Cold War , and its alternative to Russian oil – Iran – is not palatable to the Americans .
A return to a Cold War strategy is clearly not in the West ’ s interest .
Threats to expel Russia from the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 or keep it out of the World Trade Organization will only increase its sense of isolation , strengthen its authoritarianism , and push it into the role of a revolutionary anti ##AT##-##AT## status quo power in the Soviet Union ’ s old sphere of influence and beyond .
Russian minorities still waiting to be “ redeemed ” in Ukraine , the Baltic states , and Moldova are potential triggers for Russia ’ s neo ##AT##-##AT## imperialism .
But , as a power burdened with too many domestic ills and a chronic sense of insecurity along its vast and dangerously depopulated borders , Russia cannot be interested in a Cold War II , either .
Its recent agreement with China on border demarcation notwithstanding , Russia can never be assured of China ’ s ultimate intentions as a colossal power hungry for raw materials for its booming economy and living space for its massive population .
As the war in the Caucasus has shown , the global economy does not offer a foolproof guarantee against war .
But it is one thing to take a calculated risk , as the Russians did in rightly assuming that the West would not go to war over Georgia ; it is another thing for Russia to jeopardize its colossal economic gains of recent years in an all ##AT##-##AT## out confrontation with the West .
Indeed , the war in Georgia already has thrown Russia into the most severe financial crisis since its virtual bankruptcy in 1998 ; $ 17 billion were lost in capital flight in just one week .
The Moscow stock exchange lost 15 % of its value in August , and Russia ’ s central bank forecasts a 25 % decline in foreign investment this year .
Russia must seek genuine strategic partnership with the US , and the latter must understand that , when excluded and despised , Russia can be a major global spoiler .
Ignored and humiliated by the US since the Cold War ended , Russia needs integration into a new global order that respects its interests as a resurgent power , not an anti ##AT##-##AT## Western strategy of confrontation .
Forty years after the Six Day War peace between Israelis and Palestinians seems as distant as ever .
Israel still refuses to accept the new Palestinian national unity government as a negotiating partner because Hamas is part of that government .
What is the cause of this seeming paradox ?
Is there any hope ?
The Palestinian government is united administratively , but divided politically .
The Palestinians have one government with two policies .
Politically , Palestine ’ s Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh remains against recognizing Israel and respecting the existing agreements .
He declared that he is for the continuation of resistance in all forms .
What kind of guarantee of a good faith effort to reach a peace agreement can come from such a stance ?
That is the question the European Union needs to ask itself as it debates whether to resume providing financial aid to the Palestinian Authority .
The EU should make it clear to Hamas that the Union is not going to finance terror and is not going to finance a refusal to make peace .
If the Palestinians want to have European help – which I support completely – it must be ready to make peace , not to break peace .
After all , it is not Hamas as a party that is objectionable ; what is objectionable are the politics and policies which Hamas pursues .
We have nothing against Hamas ; we are against their belligerent policies , which service in government has not changed .
There was a time when the PLO held positions that were the same as those of Hamas .
Then the PLO changed .
If the current Palestinian leadership changes its position , there will be no problem from our side .
We will have nothing against negotiations .
We are for negotiations .
We are for the “ two ##AT##-##AT## state solution . ”
We accept the Middle East “ road map . ”
What we are against is terror .
Where we cannot agree , however , is on a “ right of return ” for Palestinians .
If such a right were recognized , there would be a Palestinian majority instead of a Jewish majority , which would mean the end of the Jewish state .
This is a demographic , not a religious , question : an Arab state is where the Arabs are the majority , and the Jewish state is where the Jews are the majority .
Indeed , the “ right of return ” contradicts the very idea of a two ##AT##-##AT## state solution , as it would mean one state – a Palestinian state .
Nobody in Israel will accept this .
But there are other problems in the region that Israel – and the world – must face .
The Palestinians ’ current unity government resulted from Saudi mediation , which came in response mainly to Iran ’ s ambition to increase its influence , not only in Iraq , but also in Lebanon , Gaza , and the West Bank .
Of course , that issue is completely outside Israel ’ s control .
The ongoing fight in the Muslim world between Sunnis and Shi ’ a recalls the struggle between Protestants and Catholics in seventeenth ##AT##-##AT## century Europe .
So it is little wonder that the Saudis , Jordanians , Egyptians , and the Gulf states are seeking to resist Iran ’ s hegemonic ambitions in the region .
Nevertheless , the stakes are far higher than in the seventeenth century , because Iran represents a threat that combines a fanatic religion with a determination to acquire nuclear weapons .
Indeed , Iran is the only country that openly declares its desire to destroy another member of the United Nations .
That is a threat that every country is obliged to take seriously .
When a country ’ s president delivers crazy speeches , denies the Holocaust , and does not hide his ambition to control the Middle East , who can guarantee that the threat is not serious ?
The issue is not one of restoring nuclear “ balance ” to the Middle East , as Iran ’ s leaders maintain .
First of all , Israel does not threaten anybody .
Israel never said that it wants to destroy Iran ; Israel never openly proclaimed that it would enrich uranium and build nuclear bombs in order to destroy another country .
On the contrary , Israel has said that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East .
But that does not mean that we can afford to ignore an obvious threat from countries that want to destroy us .
Despite the current unfavorable situation , the path to stabilizing the Middle East still leads through joint economic projects .
Even now , Israel is planning to build a new “ corridor of peace , ” which will comprise the Jordanians , the Palestinians , and us .
Within the framework of this project , we are seeking to halt the dehydration of the Dead Sea , build a joint airport and a joint water network with Jordan , and develop tourism infrastructure , at a cost of up to $ 5 billion .
We have the donors , so there is no shortage of money to finance our efforts , which , I am sure , will be realized .
Israel wants – indeed , desperately needs – peace and stability in the Middle East , and we will continue to do everything in our power to achieve it .
But we cannot reach that goal alone , much less negotiate with those whose idea of a stable and peaceful Middle East is one that has no place for Israel .
WASHINGTON , DC – According to Voltaire , the Roman Empire fell “ because all things fall . ”
It is hard to argue with this as a general statement about decline : nothing lasts forever .
But it is also not very useful .
In thinking , for example , about American predominance in the world today , it would be nice to know when it will decline , and whether the United States can do anything to postpone the inevitable .
Contemporary commenters despaired of the Roman Empire for several hundred years before it finally collapsed .
Could America find its way to a similar extension ?
In terms of providing an essential structure for discussion of this problem , Arvind Subramanian ’ s new book , Eclipse : Living in the Shadow of China ’ s Economic Dominance , is a major contribution .
( Full disclosure : Subramanian and I are colleagues at the Peterson Institute for International Economics , and we have worked together on other issues . )
In particular , Subramanian develops an index of economic dominance that should become a focus of conversation anywhere that people want to think about changes in world economic leadership .
There is no need to know any economics in order to be fascinated by this book : it is about power , pure and simple .
The basic facts are incontrovertible .
The United Kingdom was the world ’ s dominant economic power from the rise of industrialization in the early nineteenth century .
But it lost its predominance and was gradually eclipsed by the US , which , at least since 1945 , has been the undisputed leader among market ##AT##-##AT## based economies .
The US surpassed the UK in terms of industrial production as early as the end of the nineteenth century , but that was not enough to tip the balance .
Economic predominance shifted only when the UK ran large current ##AT##-##AT## account deficits during World Wars I and II – the country had to borrow heavily in order to finance its war effort , and imports were significantly higher than exports .
Much of the world ’ s gold reserves ended up in the hands of the US .
This helped undermine the role of the British pound internationally and catapulted the US dollar to the fore – particularly after the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 , at which it was agreed that countries would hold their reserves in dollars as well as gold .
More recently , however , it has been the Americans ’ turn consistently to run large current ##AT##-##AT## account deficits , buying more from the rest of the world than they earn by selling goods and services abroad .
On this dimension , the US seems destined to repeat the mistake of the British .
At the same time , emerging ##AT##-##AT## market countries ’ per capita income has risen – as has their international role .
In particular , China has followed a strategy in the past decade or so that entails running large current ##AT##-##AT## account surpluses and building up foreign ##AT##-##AT## exchange reserves , which are now reported to be in excess of $ 3 trillion .
Indeed , Subramanian ’ s most provocative argument is that China has already surpassed the US in terms of economic dominance – but we have not yet woken up to this new reality .
The story is fascinating and well told ; but there is still a great deal worth arguing .
For example , did the British decline because the US could not be stopped , or because of problems within the British Empire and at home ?
A few years ago , some regarded Japan as having overtaken the US .
Europe also was supposedly vying for global economic dominance .
Now any such claims would seem preposterous .
In both cases , the credit system got out of control , with too much lending to the private sector in 1980 ’ s Japan and excessive government borrowing during the 2000 ’ s in the eurozone .
Similarly , it remains unclear that the Chinese development path will remain smooth .
Fixed investment in China is close to 50 % of GDP – which must be a world record .
Credit to state firms and to households continues to grow rapidly .
Isn ’ t this a version of exactly what derailed Japanese growth ?
On the key issue of being able to issue a “ reserve currency ” that investors and governments want to hold , Subramanian is correct that China has many of the prerequisites in place .
But it still lacks some key elements , including fully ##AT##-##AT## fledged property rights .
If you worry about getting your money out of a country when times turn tough , China is not an attractive place to hold your reserves .
External challenges do sometimes bring down states .
But , more frequently , the big problems are internal – the regime cannot deliver growth , its legitimacy fades , and people start to head for the exits ( or at least get their money out ) .
If the US is eclipsed any time soon , this will more likely be due to its loss of social cohesion and its dysfunctional politics .
China might well step in to fill that vacuum , but that is quite different from being able to elbow America aside .
PARIS – With the deepening of the economic crisis and the prospect of another recession looming large on the horizon , growing social inequality has become an increasingly urgent issue .
How does one reinforce a sense of solidarity and responsibility within a country ?
Who will protect the weakest ?
As I ponder this issue , I am reminded of a debate that I had more than ten years ago in Berlin with the German theologian Hans Küng and American and Asian participants .
The subject was “ Globalization and Ethics ” – specifically , a comparison of the ways that Europe , the United States and Asia protect the most fragile members of their respective societies .
All of the participants agreed that in Europe the state traditionally filled the role played by private philantropy in the US and by the family in Asia .
But we all hastened to add that no model was “ pure , ” i.e. , the family was no longer what it used to be in Asia , the state was playing a bigger role than expected in America , and it was often underperforming in Europe .
Reality has become even more complicated since then : the family ’ s role continues to decline in Asia ; philantropy , despite a few extraordinarily generous individuals , has more than met its limits in America ; and , with the possible exception of the Nordic countries , the state in Europe , overburdened by debt , no longer has the means or the will to shoulder new responsibilities .
So who will take on the responsibility to protect the weakest if none of these three actors can do it properly ?
Are we heading toward a world united by shared incompetence and inadequacy ?
In the Western world , the poorest are the worst affected by economic stagnation .
But , in rapidly growing emerging ##AT##-##AT## market countries , the rich tend to close their eyes to the suffering of the poorest , except when they feel threatened by the risk of political upheaval , as in , say , Saudi Arabia .
In fact , wealthy elites in emerging countries live in a state of denial towards their poor , literally ignoring them .
Brazil and India are particularly striking in this regard .
Economic growth is necessary , but not sufficient : a strong sense of social responsibility is needed as well .
It would be absurd to condemn , as some do , globalization as the main and only culprit in the erosion of traditional sources of support for the poor .
Globalization is above all a context , an environment , even if the consequences of the first major financial and economic crisis of the global age will further deepen the gap between the very rich and the very poor .
But globalization makes the weakest among us more visible , and therefore makes the absence of social justice more unacceptable .
A world of much greater transparency and interdependency creates new responsibilities for the rich .
Or , more precisely , it makes the old responsibility to protect the weakest both more difficult and more urgent .
In a world of increasing complexity , perhaps what is needed are simple solutions .
One could follow , for example , Adam Smith ’ s principle of comparative advantage : what Europe does best is the state , while Asia still relies on the family and the US continues to focus on individual initiative .
The problem is that in a world of universal benchmarking , the legitimacy of solutions will stem more than ever from their cultural acceptability and their efficiency .
In Western Europe , for example , the call for sacrifice from all citizens in order to resolve the debt crisis runs up against a lingering perception that not all will contribute equally , and that social inequality will be exacerbated by austerity .
Restoring growth in the short term while addressing debt problems in the medium and long term may well be the only valid response to the crisis .
But it will not work , in Europe or elsewhere , without a much greater emphasis on social justice .
While some of the very rich complain , as Warren Buffett did recently , that they do not pay enough taxes , the enlightened generosity of these happy few – who want to save capitalism and liberalism – is unlikely to be emulated by the new rich in the emerging countries , much less by the rich elsewhere .
Let ’ s be realistic : people like Buffett and Bill Gates have very few followers even among the very rich in the US .
And can Asian societies really revive an effective sense of family responsibility ?
Globalization does appear to have weakened cultural differences noticeably in the past decade .
But , when it comes to the protection of the weakest and the struggle against rising social injustice , perhaps “ global deculturation ” creates an opportunity to combine the best of what remains in particular traditions .
Perhaps countries should seek to base their social ##AT##-##AT## welfare systems on a new synthesis of the state , the family , and philanthropy .
LONDON : The glow of optimism at the European Union &apos;s Helsinki summit last month , when EU leaders decided to extend membership negotiations to all ten candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe , plus Malta and Cyprus , is fading fast .
It has now become crystal clear that enlargement is going to be a very difficult process : difficult to negotiate , and just as difficult , perhaps , to sell to the voters .
The predicament can be expressed in stark terms : Who Will Pay the Price of Enlargement ?
Enlargement will not be cost ##AT##-##AT## free : there will be losers , as well as winners .
But the common dilemma facing all sides in this negotiation , the ins as well as the outs , is to make sure that there are not too many losers in any one country .
Otherwise , enlargement simply will not get past the voters .
The most immediate manifestation of this predicament is the European Union &apos;s Common Agricultural Policy .
This policy has long been a burden , both on EU consumers , because it has kept food prices high , and on EU taxpayers , because the subsidy to farmers &apos; incomes costs the Union some e ( Euro ) 41bn every year ( about $ 40bn ) , or around half of the total EU budget .
But it has been part of the core bargain which has kept the union together .
On purely economic grounds , subsidising EU farmers has no justification , and it is an increasing anomaly in a world of global markets and international competition .
At the start of the Common Market , it was the political price insisted on by France , a major agricultural country , as the condition for opening the French market to German industrial goods .
Today , that bargain has lost most of its original justification .
France is now an immensely rich and powerful industrial country ; and though it is still one of the world &apos;s great food producers , its farm population has shrivelled from around 30 % of the total population after World War II to around 5 % today .
Most EU governments , including the French , now recognise that the CAP must be reformed , if only because of international pressure from other food ##AT##-##AT## exporting countries .
And in recent years , the EU has at least started to reduce the market support prices of some foods , while compensating farmers by making direct income supplement payments instead .
The trouble is that the candidate countries now seeking membership are keen to get their share of the CAP gravy .
The six front ##AT##-##AT## running countries ( Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Cyprus ) recently submitted position papers to the EU demanding that their farm sectors should participate fully in the CAP from Day 1 , and that their farmers should get all the benefits , including income support payments .
It is not clear that this opening position is wise , in economic terms .
One social justification for the CAP is to prevent too large a gap between rural and industrial incomes in the existing EU .
But all incomes in the candidate countries are much lower than those in the EU , and if EU membership were to give a sudden upward shove to rural incomes in Central Europe , it could be quite destabilising for social relations there .
Moreover , it might also seriously distort economic development , by attracting excessive investment into agriculture .
Nor is it clear that this opening position is prudent in negotiating terms .
If all the benefits of the CAP were paid in full in all the six front runners , the cost to the EU budget could be an extra e6bn a year , and virtually all of that would have to be paid by existing member states , because they are so much richer .
But they have made no provision for this kind of spending , and are unlikely to agree to it .
One solution mooted by the Commission as a way of finessing the problem is to have a long transition period between membership of the EU , and full participation in the CAP .
But the position papers of the candidate countries explicitly rule out this delaying tactic .
The farm policy puzzle will be followed by a similar predicament over EU regional and social policies .
By definition these funds now go mainly to the poorer parts of the EU .
Candidate countries , however , are poorer still , so the full application of these regional policies would call for large extra budgetary transfers to Central and Eastern Europe .
At issue here is not mainly justice and morality .
Of course , justice and morality come into it , and these emotive banners will no doubt be waved by candidate countries during the negotiations .
But these are not likely to be the decisive considerations .
The first decisive consideration will be the operational feasibility of the negotiation process , which means striking a politically acceptable balance between winners and losers throughout the enlarged Union .
It is difficult to over ##AT##-##AT## state what a difficult task that may turn out to be . Remember , it only needs the voters of one member state to say No , and the whole process fails .
The second consideration is the future architecture of the enlarged EU .
Postponing access to the CAP may seem a partial solution to this problem ; but it is also a partial step towards creating a two ##AT##-##AT## tier Union .
Given the immense disparities in economic and other development , between the EU and the candidate countries , it may be debatable whether it will be possible to create a unitary or one ##AT##-##AT## tier Union with 27 ##AT##-##AT## plus countries .
But if not , what will be the architecture of this enlarged EU ?
Unfortunately , this is a question which the member states have not thought about , and apparently do not wish to think about .
SINGAPORE – Barack Obama ’ s election comes at a moment when a new bit of conventional wisdom is congealing .
It concerns the end of America ’ s global dominance .
True , freewheeling American ##AT##-##AT## style capitalism has not acquitted itself proudly of late .
And America ’ s military superiority has not proved all that useful in accomplishing American ends .
But who may pick up the slack in providing global leadership ?
The uncomfortable answer that Obama is likely to confront is this : nobody .
America may be damaged , but no replacement is on offer .
Europe is self ##AT##-##AT## absorbed , focused on creating whatever kind of entity it ends up deciding to be .
China ’ s standard response to any suggestion that it exercise global leadership is to hide beneath its vast internal agenda and plead poverty .
No other country comes close to having either the capacity or the ambition .
In the face of the familiar litany of desperate global problems – not just financial instability , but also climate change , energy insecurity , potential pandemics , terrorism , and the spread of weapons of mass destruction – the prospect of a rudderless world is more than alarming .
What is to be done ?
And by whom ?
Given that the United States has not been playing much of a leadership role on many of these issues recently , it is worth taking a look at what happens when no one country exercises effective leadership .
One set of answers might seem apparent from the collapse of international trade negotiations and the unraveling international system to control the spread of nuclear weapons . Things can certainly get grim .
But that is not the whole story .
To see why , consider climate change .
It is now clear that avoiding catastrophic climate change requires dramatic and rapid reductions in greenhouse ##AT##-##AT## gas emissions , cuts that would lower annual emissions to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 .
Yet emissions are not just rising , but accelerating .
The coming recession may stem their growth temporarily , but only slightly .
The necessary reductions imply a rapid and radical transformation of industrial , energy , and land ##AT##-##AT## use systems around the world .
What are governments doing about this ?
Supposedly , by December 2009 they will agree on a new treaty to set limits on emissions .
But the prospects that an agreement will be reached in Copenhagen in December 2009 are close to nil .
The new Obama administration will have only a few months to develop meaningful proposals that can win domestic support , and will be preoccupied with the aftermath of the current financial debacle and the Iraq war .
Europe is pushing for ambitious targets but is having trouble with its own vested interests .
The large emerging countries , although they will suffer disproportionately from wilder weather and rising sea levels , show little interest in picking up the slack .
Negotiation watchers term the current American ##AT##-##AT## Chinese dance of mutual blame a suicide pact .
In short , the process is a mess .
This is hardly surprising .
An inter ##AT##-##AT## governmental system that falls apart under the challenges of trade negotiations and proliferation threats is unlikely to master the deep complexity and multitudinous vested interests that the issue of climate change entails .
Traditional diplomacy will at best devise a face ##AT##-##AT## saving but meaningless accord next year .
In many areas , frustration with inter ##AT##-##AT## governmental intransigence and incompetence has sparked extraordinary innovation by non ##AT##-##AT## governmental organizations , corporations , and ordinary people .
Private organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council and the Marine Stewardship Council provide and , increasingly , implement environmental standards where inter ##AT##-##AT## governmental action has failed .
Private actors from foundations to pharmaceutical corporations to NGOs are actively experimenting with alternative ways to tackle transnational health challenges .
Often governments are part of these experiments – but they are not necessarily the drivers , and progress does not depend on signing treaties .
Indeed , there are many ways to put matters on the global agenda , as shown by Bono ’ s campaigns on African development and Al Gore ’ s on climate change .
Agreements about how to make things better already frequently include NGOs and corporations in various capacities – and sometimes exclude governments altogether .
Private groups using everything from satellite imagery ( as in forestry ) to the unofficial equivalent of on ##AT##-##AT## site inspections ( as in human rights ) monitor who is abiding by – or violating – what standard of behavior .
While enforcement in the coercive sense remains the domain of states , coercive enforcement is rare even when it comes to inter ##AT##-##AT## governmental agreements .
Whether countries abide by agreements has far more to do with international processes of persuasion , socialization , and capacity ##AT##-##AT## building – and those can be done by anyone with a good argument .
The big question today is whether all these alternative approaches can add up to more than a bit of desperate tinkering around the edges .
Standard international ##AT##-##AT## relations thinking does not even entertain the question , and those conventional ways of seeing the world have blinded us to looking at this crucial question .
As a result , we do not yet know the answer .
Data remain scarce .
There are hundreds of global public ##AT##-##AT## private partnerships working on various global ills – but few have been examined to see what good they do .
The mishmash of initiatives , actors , campaigns , and appeals creates opportunities for major progress – and mass confusion .
If there is to be real progress toward more effective and efficient global governance that can address the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change and the rest of the global agenda , we must do much more than look for an easy replacement for American hegemony .
We must figure out how to make sense of this enormous diversity of ways of saving the world .
The top priority for the European Union at the beginning of the twenty first century must be the historic project concealed beneath the rather boring label of ‘ enlargement ’ .
The prize is something that has never been achieved in European history : the building of a liberal order that embraces the whole continent .
To press on with this is now more vital than ever - and more difficult .
It is more difficult because public opinion in core countries of the Union , especially Germany and France , and in leading applicant countries , such as Poland and the Czech Republic , is increasingly sceptical about the process .
The electoral success of Jörg Haider in Austria has shown how effectively populist politicians can exploit fears of opening to the east .
Enlargement now seems likely to be a contentious issue in the German parliamentary elections , and perhaps also the French presidential election , both due in 2002 .
And what placates German and French voters may enrage Polish and Czech ones .
Making the case for enlargement is a challenge to democratic leadership in the whole of Europe .
With his recent suggestion that Germany should have a referendum on enlargement , Günter Verheugen , the responsible European Commissioner , has posed the right question and given the wrong answer .
The question is : Why , over more than a decade since the fall of the Berlin Wall , have the political leaders of western Europe made so little serious effect to convince their peoples that extending the European Union to the newly liberated states of central , south ##AT##-##AT## eastern and eastern Europe is in those peoples ’ own vital , long ##AT##-##AT## term interest ?
And how , belatedly , can that now be done ?
However , referendums are not the answer .
We say this not because we don ’ t trust the people , but because referendums in representative democracies are instruments to be used very sparingly , on issues that directly affect the very core of national interests , institutions and identity .
That is why France had a referendum on the Maastricht treaty , and Denmark ( on 28 September ) and Britain ( who knows when ? ) will have one on joining the euro ##AT##-##AT## zone .
But enlargement is not such an issue .
Yes , it is vitally important for all our futures .
But it does not directly impinge upon the vital interests of any EU nation .
Contrary to what the scaremongers suggest , it will not result in a vast flood of immigrants , or the loss of tens of thousands of jobs , let alone any significant further loss of national sovereignty .
Populists dramatise the short ##AT##-##AT## term costs of enlargement , while ignoring the long ##AT##-##AT## term benefits .
The task for democratic leaders is to dramatise the long ##AT##-##AT## term benefits , while placing the short ##AT##-##AT## term costs in an honest but accurate perspective .
We have nothing to fear from the facts .
Public opinion on either side of the EU ’ s current eastern frontier - Europe ’ s velvet curtain - has different concerns , but the two public opinions are also communicating vessels .
To the west , people fear immigration , job losses , and having to pay for enlargement - either directly , in increased contributions to the EU budget , or indirectly , through subsidies that go , for example , to Polish Galicia rather than to Spanish Galicia .
Ironically , the fear of ‘ instability ’ to Germany ’ s east - which nourished German support for EU enlargement - has been reduced by Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary joining NATO .
Meanwhile , east central European markets are so open for west European exporters and investors that the western businessman can selfishly say ‘ why do I need enlargement ? ’
To the east , there is disillusionment with what people see as the broken promises of west European leaders .
There is dismay at the bureaucratic rigidity and gigantism of the 80,000 pages of the acquis communautaire , which they have to adopt before being let in to the club .
They rightly consider many of these rules and regulations to be unduly protective of special interests inside the EU and harmful to a dynamic free market economy .
There are , of course , the special worries of groups such as the Polish farmers .
And there are broader concerns about giving up some of the sovereignty these countries have only recently regained .
There is also a real fear that the price for entering the paradise of Schengenland will be that they must make their own eastern frontiers fortified and impenetrable .
This is the last thing Poland wants to do with Ukraine , let alone the Czech Republic with its former Siamese twin , Slovakia , or Hungary against its own Hungarian minority in Romania .
One of the difficulties of making the case for enlargement is that to sell it in Germany or Austria requires the assurance of closed , watertight eastern borders , while to sell it in Poland , Hungary or the Czech Republic needs the promise of soft , open ones .
If not a referendum , then what is to be done ?
First and foremost , the EU must , at the latest during the Swedish presidency in the first half of 2001 , set a definite timetable for the first round of enlargement .
The fact that there was a binding timetable was one of the main reasons why Economic and Monetary Union happened in January 1999 .
It concentrated minds like nothing else .
Inspired by the recollection of EMU ’ s two target dates , we suggest that EU leaders should say : ‘ The first round of enlargement will happen , if all the conditions can be met in time , on 1 January 2003 .
It &#91; start italics &#93; must &#91; stop italics &#93; happen by 1 January 2005 . ’ And , incidentally , that first round must include Poland , which is the most difficult but also the most important country in the leading group of applicants .
Second , the European Council in Nice , this December , must , at long last , set a clear course for making those institutional reforms without which an EU of 20 and more member states will simply no longer function .
Beside reforms of Council and Commission , there is a leap of principle to be made here .
The Nice Council should endorse the principle of ‘ enhanced cooperation ’ , so long as such cooperation is flexible , transparent and genuinely , at all stages , open to all member states who wish to join .
This oppenness is a concern for the applicant countries too , who fear that otherwise they may be ‘ in ’ and yet still ‘ out ’ .
Third , the EU should consider , in discussion with all European countries who wish to join it , whether there are not parts of its now complex structures of cooperation that some of them could join before becoming full members of the EU .
One example would be areas of the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
( After all , Polish and Czech troops are already working beside British and Italian ones to rebuild Kosovo . )
Another could be early accession to the planned European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
And it would surely be fitting if the preamble to that Charter made explicit reference to the ideals of the central European revolutions of 1989 .
Fourth , we have to consider how a European perspective can be made real to the politicians and publics in the remoter parts of south ##AT##-##AT## eastern and eastern Europe .
It is one of the ironies of the last decade that at the end of it west European troops and civil servants are actually more present in Bosnia and Kosovo than they are in Bohemia or Silesia .
The stepping stones from military protectorate to political integration have to be thought out - and then spelled out .
The EU ’ s recent message to the people of Serbia and the other states of former Yugoslavia is a good beginning , but more needs to be done .
And what have we to offer Ukraine , and other countries to the east ?
Finally , and more important than any of these individual steps , the leaders of Europe have to take up the challenge and really start making the case for the larger Europe to their publics , east and west of the velvet curtain .
They need to be as serious about this as they have always been about the euro .
A weak euro may be a blessing in disguise .
A weak Europe is an unmitigated curse .
But who among our leaders will step forward to take up this challenge ?
The links between states and companies have grabbed headlines , most recently in Russia , where President Vladimir Putin seems obsessed with creating “ national champions ” in the energy and aerospace sectors .
Such efforts seem but a part of a surge of protectionism in European political debate about business , especially when it comes to cross ##AT##-##AT## border acquisitions .
Across Europe , governments position themselves to be seen as defending “ national ” players from “ foreign ” competitors .
“ Economic patriotism , ” the slogan coined by France ’ s Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin following PepsiCo ’ s rumored attempt in July 2005 to takeover Danone , perhaps best encapsulates the political imperative .
Although de Villepin ’ s speeches are more flamboyant than those of most political leaders , the underlying sentiment extends far beyond France .
The same impulse appears to be at work behind Italy ’ s policy on Autostrade , Spain ’ s on Endesa , Poland ’ s on its banking sector , the former Swedish Prime Minister ’ s on Volvo , German unease about “ locust ” -like funds on Deutsche Börse , or the United Kingdom ’ s ever louder defense of the London Stock Exchange ’ s independence from the United States .
The basic belief that underpins “ economic patriotism ” is that of an alignment of interests between companies considered “ national ” ( most prominently the largest ones or so ##AT##-##AT## called “ champions ” ) , their national employees , and the national community .
According to de Villepin , “ to defend the employees ’ interests well , we must protect the interests of our companies . ”
He later argued that Danone should be considered “ French ” because its “ milk collection and its water sources are in France . ”
But Danone ’ s own filings indicate that only 22 % of its global sales and less than 14 % of its global workforce are in France .
In fact , the link between European companies and national communities is becoming more tenuous by the day .
Research that I carried out for Bruegel surveyed the largest 100 listed companies headquartered in Europe ( ranked by market capitalization ) and analyzed the geographical distribution of their revenue , which is increasingly transparent since the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) last year .
Europe was divided into eight broad zones , comprising individual countries like Germany , France , and Italy , or groupings of smaller countries such as Benelux and the Nordic area .
The survey then calculated the share of revenue earned by each company in the zone in which it is headquartered ( or “ home base ” ) , the rest of Europe , and the rest of the world .
Where relevant information for companies was available , the comparable distribution of employees was also examined .
The results show that the share of the home base in total revenue has become , on average , relatively low : just three ##AT##-##AT## eighths , or 37.5 % , on average for Europe ’ s largest 100 companies .
Of course , this figure covers a wide diversity of industries , and also some geographical differences across the continent .
For example , the averages for German ( 34 % ) or French ( 35 % ) companies are markedly lower than for their Spanish ( 56 % ) or Italian ( 65 % ) counterparts .
But the general trend is unambiguous .
For a broadly representative sub ##AT##-##AT## sample of 55 companies that could be tracked since 1997 , the proportion of revenue generated in the home region has fallen sharply on average , from 50.2 % to 36.9 % .
For these companies , sales to the “ rest of Europe , ” which represented an average of less than 30 % of total European sales in 1997 , rose above 43 % in 2005 .
If the trend is extrapolated , the home bases of Europe ’ s largest companies will account , on average , for less than half of their European revenue , and less than a third of their global revenue , before the end of this decade .
These companies are “ Europeanizing ” fast , and the relative weight of their home base is declining even faster .
Moreover , this is not just a story about sales .
The survey also measured the geographical distribution of employees relative to the distribution of revenue .
While the distribution profiles between employees and revenue could be sharply dissimilar in some companies , on average they were almost identical : for a sub ##AT##-##AT## sample of 73 companies among Europe ’ s top 100 , the home base represented 37 % of employees and 35 % of revenue on average in 2005 , while the rest of Europe accounted for 29 % of employees and 28 % of revenue .
This strongly suggests that jobs broadly “ follow ” sales ( or perhaps the other way round ) , even though , once again , this is true only on average and not for all companies .
What are the implications for policymakers ?
Put simply , the numbers show a growing gap of interests between these so ##AT##-##AT## called “ champions ” and their national home bases .
For Europe ’ s governments , fostering champions increasingly means providing benefits to non ##AT##-##AT## national customers and employees – a dubious use of taxpayer money .
Another consequence is that regulatory competition is likely to increase in Europe , as companies are less bound by local interests to keep their headquarters at “ home ” if the tax or regulatory environment becomes unfavorable .
The decision by Depfa Bank to shift its headquarters from Wiesbaden to Dublin in 2002 may be a sign of things to come .
The biggest risk is that the growing disconnect between the perception of “ national ” companies and the reality of Europeanization may lead to spectacularly ill ##AT##-##AT## judged policies .
It is high time for business leaders to be more candid about where their real constituencies lie , and for national politicians to recognize that they can no longer wield control over the giants of today ’ s European business .
NEW YORK – Increasingly , corporations are under pressure , often from activist non ##AT##-##AT## governmental organizations , to take on specific “ corporate social responsibility ” ( CSR ) obligations .
But the fact that CSR is being demanded , and occasionally conceded , does not ensure clarity about either its rationale or the ways in which it should be undertaken .
CSR can be divided into two categories : what corporations should do ( say , contribute to a women ’ s rights NGO or build a village school ) and what they should not do ( say , dump mercury into rivers or bury hazardous materials in landfills ) .
The latter is wholly conventional and subject to regulation ( and recently to questions about how corporations should behave when there are no host ##AT##-##AT## country regulations ) .
But are CSR obligations really good practice ?
Milton Friedman and other critics often asked if it was the business of businesses to practice corporate altruism .
Prior to the rise of the corporation , there were mainly family firms , such as the Rothschilds .
When they made money , it accrued principally to the family itself .
Altruism , where it existed , also was undertaken by the family , which decided how and on what to spend its money .
Whether the firm or its shareholders and other stakeholders spent the money was beside the point .
With the rise of the business corporation , large family firms have generally disappeared .
But that does not mean that a corporation is the right entity to engage in altruism – though its various stakeholders obviously can spend any portion of the income they earn from the corporation and other sources in altruistic ways .
Instead of CSR , we should have PSR ( personal social responsibility ) .
One can also argue for PSR on the grounds that asking for CSR becomes a way of “ passing the buck ” – evading personal responsibility for doing good .
This is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee – both the subject of lawsuits in recent years .
There is also an added advantage in replacing CSR with PSR : there is virtue in diversity of approaches to altruism .
Chairman Mao wanted a hundred flowers to bloom , but only so that he could cut them all off at their roots .
But PSR is more like President George H.W. Bush ’ s metaphor of a “ thousand points of light . ”
Moreover , it is hard to see how a corporation ’ s stakeholders can always arrive democratically at a common position on how the corporation should engage in social responsibility on their behalf .
Each will consider his or her CSR view the best .
But there are strong arguments in favor of CSR as well .
First , the political reality is that society treats corporations as if they were persons , which is often also a legal reality for many purposes .
Society increasingly demands that these “ corporate citizens ” be altruistic , just as people are .
Given this reality , corporations want to give simply because it is expected of them .
Such CSR builds the firm ’ s image as a “ good ” corporation , just as giving by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet builds their image as “ good ” billionaires .
Second , many corporations view CSR as an effective defensive strategy against powerful activist NGOs ( such as Greenpeace ) that have taken to using online agitation , boycotts , and other means to “ blackmail ” targeted corporations into acceding to the activists ’ demands .
The more CSR a company can point to , the less such efforts will succeed – or even be mounted .
Consider the contrasting experiences of Coke and Pepsi .
Coke has been targeted by NGOs for alleged lapses in labor and environmental standards .
By contrast , Pepsi , which once teamed up with AT &amp; amp ; T and the CIA to oust President Salvador Allende in Chile , smells like a rose nowadays , because it has distributed CSR largesse to several causes that influential NGOs embrace .
That is a lesson that Wal ##AT##-##AT## Mart has since learned .
In 2005 , the Service Employees ’ International Union ( SEIU ) created Wal ##AT##-##AT## Mart Watch , with an annual budget of $ 5 million .
The purpose was to make Wal ##AT##-##AT## Mart a “ better employer , neighbor , and corporate citizen , ” and Wal ##AT##-##AT## Mart eventually capitulated on some of the SEIU ’ s specific demands as well .
Finally , CSR can be simply a matter of advertising .
In this case , the choice of CSR spending is focused directly on generating added revenue , much like advertising , and is aimed at sales much the way advertising is .
A benign example is Adidas ’ s sponsorship of tennis tournaments .
A malign example is Philip Morris ’ s donation of money to museums , symphony orchestras , and opera houses , cynically aimed at buying off artists who might otherwise work to ban cigarettes .
All these rationales for CSR suggest that it should be left to each corporation to determine , just as PSR leaves altruism to each individual ’ s conscience and sense of what needs supporting .
The attempt by some NGOs and activists to impose a straitjacket on CSR , reflecting their priorities , is misguided and must be rejected .
Instead , the model should be former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan ’ s initiative , the Global Compact .
What Annan has done is to embrace ten wide ##AT##-##AT## ranging guiding principles while leaving signatory corporations free to choose that which they wish to support actively .
In recent weeks , leaders of various opposition organizations in Georgia , such as Antisoros and Fairness , have been jailed on unfair accusations of plotting a coup on behalf of Russia .
But the wave of political repression merely reflects President Mikhail Saakashvili ’ s desperate effort to cling to power .
With popular dissent growing and opposition forces strengthening , the authorities have sought to controll non ##AT##-##AT## governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and strengthen the security forces .
But this will only make mass protests inevitable , ultimately jeopardizing the democratic transition in Georgia that Saakashvili claims to represent .
Saakashvili sees a “ Moscow hand ” in every challenge to his authority , which could be explained by his government ’ s close alliance with the United States .
But the people rounded up in the latest raid against the opposition were originally imprisoned by Eduard Shevarnadze ’ s government , which Saakashvili helped depose in Georgia ’ s supposedly democratic “ Rose revolution ” in 2003 .
The latest events clearly indicate that a czarist mentality survived the revolution , reflected in a Byzantine model of political power — an emperor and his court — that has as its main vehicle largely unconstrained presidential authority .
Before the security forces targeted the opposition bloc that I represent , supporters of educational reforms were prosecuted , while most of the press is under the influence of the government .
Saakashvili claims that the opposition forces that I represent oppose Western values .
But we advocate parliamentarism – genuine separation of executive and legislative power – in Georgia .
And , in supporting the Western model of parliamentariansm , we are on the side of Georgia , not Russia .
It is strange that Saakashvili , a graduate of Columbia Law School , fails to see the disparity between his own democratic rhetoric and autocratic actions .
Thus , those of us who value Georgia ’ s historical ties with Russia are called , at best , “ archaists , ” and at worst “ enemies of Georgian independence , ” as if Georgia would become a Russian colony if we ever came to power .
But what separates us from Saakashvili is that we understand that history , geography , and economics dictate close ties to Russia .
We simply see no contradiction between that stance and support for Western values .
Indeed , even Russia , with all its imperfections , cannot be said to oppose Western values .
The unfortunate paradox in Georgia – and elsewhere in the post ##AT##-##AT## Soviet world – is that self ##AT##-##AT## serving pro ##AT##-##AT## Western rhetoric has often led democratic values to be sacrificed in favor of a new dictatorship .
When the West actively supports popular revolutions , as in Georgia and Ukraine , the newly established power relies on democratic slogans , not democratic behavior .
Shevardnadze , too , was initially viewed as a symbol of post ##AT##-##AT## Soviet Georgian democracy .
As a government minister in 1993 , however , I was already hearing CIA officials express concern that a “ Mafia state ” was being created instead .
First with Shevarnadze , and now with Saakashvili , popular disillusionment reflects not rejection of democracy , but frustration with its continuing absence .
Saakashvili is evidently mesmerized by the US , and the West in general , but what is the point if there is no independent and democratic political process in Georgia today ?
And why , then , is sustaining close ties to the US so desirable , while refusing to dismiss Russia as a partner is regarded as being an agent of the Kremlin ?
Is the US , in contrast to Russia , by definition honest , innocent , and high ##AT##-##AT## minded ?
There should be no place for such unfortunate double standards .
Regardless of what the Saakashvili government claims about his opponents , our political orientation is not pro ##AT##-##AT## Russian , but pro ##AT##-##AT## Georgian .
We believe that Georgia should pursue its own interests , which it may share with Europe , Russia , or the US , but which are nonetheless our own .
We have no interest in merely executing US policy , or in basing Georgia ’ s foreign and domestic policy solely on distancing the country from Russia , as Saakashvili has done .
Thus , pro ##AT##-##AT## Georgian politics should not countenance nationalism .
Nowadays , some of our politicians have embraced the slogan “ Georgia for Georgians . ”
But nationalism suggests the lack of a coherent conception of Georgia ’ s interests .
Georgia ’ s tradition as a multinational , tolerant state , which has been weakened in the last 15 years , must be reinvigorated , because we have no need for enemies against which to define ourselves .
A strong relationship with Russia need not come at the expense of relations with America and the West , and vice versa .
Georgia should be neither pro ##AT##-##AT## Russian nor pro ##AT##-##AT## American .
It is a small , poor country that desperately needs stability and economic development .
Its model should not be Palestine and permanent battle , but Switzerland and permanent prosperity .
“ We are all Americans , ” wrote Le Monde on September 12 , 2001 . And so it was with most people in the Muslim world , who were as appalled as anyone else at the carnage of the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York .
Indeed , when America responded to the attacks , almost no one mourned the fall of the Taliban , who were universally condemned for their fanaticism .
This unanimity of opinion no longer exists .
In the five years since the attacks , two audiences for the so ##AT##-##AT## called “ war on terror ” have emerged .
Indeed , as the “ war ” progressed , the audience closest to the action began to see the emerging combat in a way that was diametrically opposed to that of the United States and the West .
To the US administration , every act in the drama of the war on terror was seen as discrete and self ##AT##-##AT## contained : Afghanistan , Iraq , Palestine , and Hezbollah in Lebanon .
The Bush administration , having proclaimed a war on terror , invaded and occupied countries , and yet failed to see that these events were being linked in the eyes of people in the region .
Glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite channels , the various battles of the “ war on terror ” came to be viewed as a single chain of events in a grand plot against Islam .
Worse yet , America waved the banner of democracy as it prosecuted its wars . But hopes for democracy , be it secular or Islamist , for the people concerned have been buried in the rubble and carnage of Baghdad , Beirut , and Kandahar .
Many Muslims understand – as well as anyone in the West , and in the same terms – the underlying causes of the alienation that animates Islamic radicalism and violence . They know that the rigid dictatorships of the region have paralyzed their populations . Only those consumed by the fires of their rage seem able to melt the shackles of these authoritarian societies .
But the price of escape is a kind of deformation .
Embittered , fanatical , vengeful : those who rebel against the status quo enter the wider world seeking retaliation , not just against the regimes that deformed them , but against the West , which propped up the region ’ s authoritarians in the interest of “ stability . ”
Many Muslims also understand that the problem of Palestine , unsolved for three generations , goes beyond the suffering of the Palestinian people . They know that the region ’ s dictators have used Palestine to justify their misrule and to avoid political and economic liberalization .
So when America called for democracy , the hearts of many in the region soared with the hope that reform would come at last . But America , as so many times before , let them down .
As people at last began to hope for more liberal and decent societies , the US continued to endorse the regimes that were repressing them . America simply could not adhere to its own democracy ##AT##-##AT## promotion script .
After the ouster of the Taliban in Afghanistan , the US turned its sights on the secular dictatorship of Saddam Hussein ’ s Iraq . Instead of encouraging reform of the Saudi / Wahhabi regime – the system that spawned 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9 / 11 attacks – the average Muslim saw America as waging war on a regime that had nothing to do with that crime .
Many Muslims acquiesced in this deviation , viewing the invasion of Iraq as part of the passing of dictatorship and the coming of democracy . But the bloodstained shambles of the US occupation led America to abandon the quest for democracy .
The deeper America sank into the Iraqi quagmire , the more the US began to turn a blind eye to the region ’ s surviving dictators , particularly those in Saudi Arabia , Syria , Egypt , and Pakistan .
Indeed , the last thing the region ’ s dictators wanted to see was a democratic Iraq .
Almost from the moment of Saddam ’ s fall , Saudi / Wahhabi jihadis poured into Iraq almost unimpeded .
Worse yet , the Muslims who supported the project to democratize Iraq widely suspect that the Sunni resistance that incited the Iraqi civil war has been financed by Saudi oil money .
( Terrorism also kept Iraqi oil from becoming a serious challenger to Saudi Arabia . )
So the effort to democratize Iraq – indeed , the entire American project to democratize the region – has fallen under deep suspicion by even the most moderate of Muslims .
America , they believe , only wants a democracy that suits its interests .
If Palestinians freely vote for Hamas , their choice is actively opposed .
Lebanon ’ s “ Cedar Revolution , ” which galvanized the West in the same way as Ukraine ’ s Orange Revolution , has been systematically undermined .
With democracy in most of the region still a long way off – indeed , perhaps a more distant prospect now than five years ago – US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeats her mantra that the dead civilians of Beirut , Sidon , Tyre , and Gaza represent the “ birth pangs ” of a new Middle East .
But until the West stops regarding dead babies as political props , we cannot understand how the Muslim world perceives all that has happened since September 11 , 2001 .
Only then will we understand why the unified view of five years ago has fractured so violently .
NEW YORK – US President Barack Obama ’ s nomination of Jim Yong Kim for the presidency of the World Bank has been well received – and rightly so , especially given some of the other names that were bandied about .
In Kim , a public ##AT##-##AT## health professor who is now President of Dartmouth College and previously led the World Health Organization ’ s HIV / AIDS department , the United States has put forward a good candidate .
But the candidate ’ s nationality , and the nominating country – whether small and poor or large and rich – should play no role in determining who gets the job .
The World Bank ’ s 11 executive directors from emerging and developing countries have put forward two excellent candidates , Ngozi Okonjo ##AT##-##AT## Iweala of Nigeria and Jose Antonio Ocampo of Colombia .
I have worked closely with both of them .
Both are first ##AT##-##AT## rate , have served as ministers with multiple portfolios , have performed admirably in top positions in multilateral organizations , and have the diplomatic skills and professional competence to do an outstanding job .
They understand finance and economics , the bread and butter of the World Bank , and have a network of connections to leverage the Bank ’ s effectiveness .
Okonjo ##AT##-##AT## Iweala brings an insider ’ s knowledge of the institution .
Ocampo , like Kim , brings the advantages and disadvantages of being an outsider ; but Ocampo , a distinguished professor at Columbia University , is thoroughly acquainted with the World Bank .
He previously served not only as minister of economics and finance , but also of agriculture – a critically important qualification , given that the vast majority of the developing countries ’ poor depend on farming .
He also brings impressive environmental credentials , addressing another of the Bank &apos;s central concerns .
Both Okonjo ##AT##-##AT## Iweala and Ocampo understand the role of international financial institutions in providing global public goods .
Throughout their careers , their hearts and minds have been devoted to development , and to fulfilling the World Bank ’ s mission of eliminating poverty .
They have set a high bar for any American candidate .
Much is at stake .
Almost two billion people remain in poverty in the developing world , and , while the World Bank cannot solve the problem on its own , it plays a leading role .
Despite its name , the Bank is primarily an international development institution .
Kim ’ s specialty , public health , is critical , and the Bank has long supported innovative initiatives in this field . But health is only a small part of the Bank ’ s “ portfolio , ” and it typically works in this area with partners who bring to the table expertise in medicine .
Rumors suggest that the US is likely to insist on maintaining the perverse selection process in which it gets to pick the World Bank ’ s president , simply because , in this election year , Obama ’ s opponents would trumpet loss of control over the choice as a sign of weakness .
And it is more important for the US to retain that control than it is for emerging and developing countries to obtain it .
Indeed , the more powerful of the emerging markets know how to live within the current system , and they may use it to their advantage .
They will , in effect , obtain an IOU , to be cashed in for something that is more important .
The Realpolitik of the moment makes fighting over the presidency unlikely ; America may well prevail .
But at what cost ?
Should America continue to insist on controlling the selection process , it is the Bank itself that would suffer .
For years , the Bank ’ s effectiveness was compromised because it was seen , in part , as a tool of Western governments and their countries ’ financial and corporate sectors .
Ironically , even America ’ s long ##AT##-##AT## term interests would be best served by a commitment – not just in words , but also in deeds – to a merit ##AT##-##AT## based system and good governance .
One supposed achievement of the G ##AT##-##AT## 20 was an agreement to reform the governance of the international financial institutions – most importantly , how their leaders are selected .
Since expertise on development by and large lies within the emerging and developing countries – after all , they live development – it seems natural that the World Bank ’ s head would come from one of those countries .
To maintain a cabal among developed countries , whereby the US appoints the World Bank president and Europe picks the International Monetary Fund ’ s head , seems particularly anachronistic and perplexing today , when the Bank and the Fund are turning to emerging ##AT##-##AT## market countries as a source of funds .
While the US , the international community , and the Bank itself repeatedly emphasize the importance of good governance , a selection procedure that de facto leaves the appointment to the US president makes a mockery of it .
Okonjo ##AT##-##AT## Iweala put the matter forcefully in an interview with the Financial Times : what is at stake is a matter of hypocrisy .
The integrity of the advanced industrial countries , which have a majority of the votes at the World Bank , is being put to the test .
CAMBRIDGE – As the US economy limps toward the second anniversary of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy , anemic growth has left unemployment mired near 10 % , with little prospect of significant improvement anytime soon .
Little wonder that , with mid ##AT##-##AT## term congressional elections coming in November , Americans are angrily asking why the government ’ s hyper ##AT##-##AT## aggressive stimulus policies have not turned things around .
What more , if anything , can be done ?
The honest answer – but one that few voters want to hear – is that there is no magic bullet .
It took more than a decade to dig today ’ s hole , and climbing out of it will take a while , too .
As Carmen Reinhart and I warned in our 2009 book on the 800 ##AT##-##AT## year history of financial crises ( with the ironic title “ This Time is Different ” ) , slow , protracted recovery with sustained high unemployment is the norm in the aftermath of a deep financial crisis .
Why is it so tough to boost employment rapidly after a financial crisis ?
One reason , of course , is that the financial system takes time to heal – and thus for credit to begin flowing properly again .
Pumping vast taxpayer funds into financial behemoths does not solve the deeper problem of deflating an overleveraged society .
Americans borrowed and shopped until they were blue in the face , thinking that an ever ##AT##-##AT## rising housing price market would wash away all financial sins .
The rest of the world poured money into the US , making it seem as if life was one big free lunch .
Even now , many Americans believe that the simple solution to the nation ’ s problem is just to cut taxes and goose up private consumption .
Cutting taxes is certainly not bad in principle , especially for supporting long ##AT##-##AT## term investment and growth .
But there are several problems with the gospel of lower taxes .
First , total public ##AT##-##AT## sector debt ( including state and local debt ) is already nearing the 119 % -of ##AT##-##AT## GDP peak reached after World War II .
Some argue passionately that now is no time to worry about future debt problems , but , in my view , any realistic assessment of the medium ##AT##-##AT## term risks does not permit us simply to dismiss such concerns .
A second problem with tax cuts is that they might well have only a limited impact on demand in the short run , with the private sector hoarding a significant share of the funds to repair badly over ##AT##-##AT## leveraged balance sheets .
Last but not least , there is a fairness issue .
By some measures , nearly half of all Americans do not pay any income tax already , so cutting taxes skews an already very unequal income distribution .
Deferred maintenance on income equality is one of many imbalances that built up in the US economy during the pre ##AT##-##AT## crisis boom .
If allowed to fester , the political consequences could be severe , including trade protectionism and perhaps even social unrest .
Those who think that the government should take up the slack in private spending point out that there is an abundance of growth ##AT##-##AT## enhancing projects – a point that should be obvious to anyone familiar with America ’ s fraying infrastructure .
Likewise , transfers to state and local governments , which have limited constitutional scope to borrow , would help slow down wrenching layoffs of teachers , firefighters , and police .
Lastly , extending unemployment insurance in the wake of a once ##AT##-##AT## in ##AT##-##AT## a-half ##AT##-##AT## century crisis should be a no ##AT##-##AT## brainer .
But , unfortunately , Keynesian demand management is no panacea , either .
Nor can the government always be the employer of last resort .
While tax cuts enhance long ##AT##-##AT## term productivity , expanding the government sector is hardly a recipe for economic vitality .
There are surely many useful activities for the government to undertake in a market economy , but a frenzied orgy of stimulus spending is not conducive to rational discussion of what they should be .
And of course , there again is the matter of the soaring national debt .
All in all , the G ##AT##-##AT## 20 ’ s policy of aiming for gradual stabilization of growth in government debt , bringing it into line with national ##AT##-##AT## income growth by 2016 , seems a reasonable approach to balancing short ##AT##-##AT## term stimulus against longer ##AT##-##AT## term financial risks , even at the cost of lingering unemployment .
While America is facing the limits of fiscal policy , monetary policy can do more , as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke detailed in a recent speech in Jackson Hole , Wyoming .
With credit markets impaired , the Fed could buy more government bonds or private ##AT##-##AT## sector debt .
Bernanke also noted the possibility of temporarily raising the Fed ’ s medium ##AT##-##AT## term inflation target ( a policy that I suggested in this column in December 2008 ) .
Given the massive deleveraging of public- and private ##AT##-##AT## sector debt that lies ahead , and my continuing cynicism about the US political and legal system ’ s capacity to facilitate workouts , two or three years of slightly elevated inflation strikes me as the best of many very bad options , and far preferable to deflation .
While the Fed is still reluctant to compromise its long ##AT##-##AT## term independence , I suspect that before this is over it will use most , if not all , of the tools outlined by Bernanke .
The bottom line is that Americans will have to be patient for many years as the financial sector regains its health and the economy climbs slowly out of its hole .
The government can certainly help , but beware of pied pipers touting quick fixes .
I have never been heavily involved in partisan politics , but these are not normal times .
President George W. Bush is endangering the United States and the world &apos;s safety while undermining American values .
For opposing him , I have been demonized by the Bush campaign .
President Bush ran in 2000 on a platform promising a &quot; humble &quot; foreign policy .
If re ##AT##-##AT## elected , the Bush doctrine of preemptive action - and the invasion of Iraq - will be endorsed , and the world will have to live with the consequences .
By repudiating Bush &apos;s policies at the polls , America will have a chance to regain the respect and support of the world .
The terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , required a strong response .
But they also led to suspension of the critical process so essential to a democracy - a full and fair discussion of the issues .
Bush silenced criticism by calling it unpatriotic .
For 18 months after 9 / 11 , he managed to suppress all dissent .
That is how he led America in the wrong direction .
In fact , Bush played right into the hands of Osama bin Laden .
Afghanistan &apos;s invasion was justified : that was where bin Laden lived and al Qaeda had its training camps .
Invading Iraq was not .
It was Bush &apos;s unintended gift to bin Laden .
Immediately after 9 / 11 , there was a spontaneous outpouring of sympathy for America worldwide .
It has given way to widespread resentment .
There are many more people willing to risk their lives to kill Americans than there were on September 11 .
Bush likes to insist that terrorists hate Americans for what they are - a freedom loving people - not what they do .
But war and occupation create innocent victims .
We count the body bags of American soldiers - over 1,000 in Iraq .
The wider world also counts the Iraqis who get killed daily , perhaps 20 times more .
Nor was the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison the work of a few bad apples .
It was part of a system of dealing with prisoners put in place by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
Public opinion condemns America worldwide , and our troops in Iraq are paying the price .
Bush convinced people that he is good for American security by playing on the fears generated by the 9 / 11 attacks .
At a time of peril , people rally around the flag , and Bush exploited this by fostering a sense of danger .
His campaign assumes that people do not really care about the truth and will believe almost anything if it is repeated often enough .
There must be something wrong with Americans if we fall for it .
For instance , some 40 % of Americans still believe that Saddam Hussein was connected with 9 / 11 , although the 9 / 11 Commission - set up by Bush and chaired by a Republican - definitively established that no such connection existed .
I want to shout : &quot; Wake up America .
Don &apos;t you realize we are being misled ? &quot;
The war in Iraq was misconceived from start to finish - if it has a finish .
It is a war of choice , not necessity .
Moreover , America went to war on false pretenses . Weapons of mass destruction could not be found , and the connection with al Qaeda could not be established .
Bush then claimed that America went to war to liberate Iraq .
But democracy cannot be imposed by force .
Saddam Hussein was a tyrant , and Iraqis - and the world - can rejoice in being rid of him .
But America had an obligation to maintain law and order ; instead , we stood idly by while Baghdad and other cities were ransacked .
If we had cared about the Iraqi people , we should have had more troops available for the occupation .
We should have provided protection not only for the oil ministry , but also other ministries , museums , and hospitals .
Worse still , when American soldiers encountered resistance , they employed methods - invading homes and mistreating prisoners - that alienated and humiliated the population , generating resentment and rage .
The Bush administration &apos;s flip ##AT##-##AT## flops and missteps are legion .
First the Iraqi army was dissolved , then America tried to reconstitute it .
First the US tried to eliminate the Baathists , then America turned to them for help .
When the insurgency became intractable , America installed an Iraqi government .
The man chosen to lead it was a protégé of the CIA with a reputation for being a strongman - a far cry from democracy .
Despite the Bush campaign &apos;s efforts at spin control , the situation in Iraq is dire .
Much of the western part of the country has been ceded to insurgents , the prospect of holding free and fair elections in January is fast receding , civil war looms .
Bush &apos;s war in Iraq has done untold damage to America as well , impairing its military power and undermining the morale of the armed forces .
Before the war , America could project overwhelming force .
Not anymore .
Afghanistan is slipping from control .
North Korea , Iran , Pakistan , and other countries pursue nuclear programs with renewed vigor .
The Bush administration can be criticized for many other policies , but none are as important as Iraq .
The war has cost nearly $ 200 billion , and costs will continue to mount , because getting into Iraq was much easier than getting out will be .
Bush has been taunting John Kerry to explain how he would do things differently .
Kerry has responded that he would have done everything differently , and that he would be in a better position to extricate us .
But it won &apos;t be easy for him , either , because America is caught in a quagmire .
Top military and diplomatic experts desperately warned Bush not to invade Iraq .
He ignored them .
He suppressed the critical process , arguing that any criticism of the Commander ##AT##-##AT## in ##AT##-##AT## Chief puts US troops at risk .
But this is Bush &apos;s war , and he ought to be held responsible for it .
Americans should step back for a moment and ask : who got them into this mess ?
A moment &apos;s reflection should raise another question : does Bush &apos;s Texas swagger qualify him to remain America &apos;s Commander ##AT##-##AT## in ##AT##-##AT## Chief ?
The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September 11 , 2001 , profoundly changed the US , spawning a new focus on foreign policy .
The Bush administration &apos;s new national security strategy , issued in September 2002 , identifies the combination of terrorism , rogue states , and weapons of mass destruction as the primary threat confronting America .
Most people agree with the new focus of American foreign policy , but debate the means by which it is carried out .
Is the threat so great that America must act alone , or should the US act only with the support of international institutions , even if that holds the country back ?
Events in Iraq illustrate this debate , but it has deeper roots .
In his 2000 election campaign , George W. Bush said about America , &quot; If we are an arrogant nation , they &apos;ll view us that way , but if we &apos;re a humble nation , they &apos;ll respect us . &quot;
He was right , but unfortunately many of America &apos;s friends saw the first eight months of his administration as arrogantly concerned with narrow American interests , focused on military power , and dismissive of treaties , norms , and multilateralism .
The administration &apos;s peremptory announcement that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change was &quot; dead &quot; contributed to a reaction from other countries that cost the US its seat on the UN Human Rights Commission .
September 11 th supposedly changed all that .
Congress finally paid America &apos;s UN dues , and the president turned his efforts to building a coalition against terrorism .
But the rapid success of the war in Afghanistan led some in the administration and some commentators to conclude that unilateralism works .
The columnist Charles Krauthammer , for example , urges a &quot; new unilateralism &quot; where America refuses to play the role of &quot; docile international citizen &quot; and unashamedly pursues its own ends .
The new unilateralists make a mistake in focusing too heavily on military power alone .
True , America &apos;s military power--backed up by a budget equivalent to the next eight countries combined -is essential to global stability , and an essential part of the response to terrorism .
But the metaphor of war should not blind us to the fact that suppressing terrorism will take years of patient , unspectacular civilian cooperation with other countries in areas such as intelligence sharing , police work , tracing financial flows , and cooperation among customs officials .
Military success in Afghanistan addressed the easiest part of the problem .
Al Qaeda retains cells in some fifty countries .
Rather than proving the unilateralists &apos; point , the partial nature of the success in Afghanistan illustrates the continuing need for cooperation .
Similarly , it was much easier to win the war in Iraq than to win the peace .
The problem for Americans in the 21 st century is that more issues and forces than ever before are outside the control of even the most powerful state .
What the attacks of September 11 th demonstrated is that the information revolution and globalization , have changed world politics in a way that means Americans cannot achieve all their international goals acting alone .
The US lacks both the international and domestic prerequisites to resolve conflicts internal to other societies , and to monitor and control transnational transactions that threaten Americans at home .
On many of today &apos;s key issues , such as international financial stability , drug smuggling , the spread of diseases , or global climate change , military power is ineffective .
Indeed , its use can be counterproductive .
America must instead mobilize international coalitions to address these shared threats and challenges .
The willingness of others to cooperate depends in part on their own self ##AT##-##AT## interest , but also on the attractiveness of American positions .
That power to attract is what I call &quot; soft power . &quot;
It means that others want what you want , and there is less need to use carrots and sticks to make others do what you want .
Hard power grows out of a country &apos;s military and economic might .
Soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country &apos;s culture , ideals , and policies .
Hard power will always remain vital , but soft power will become increasingly important in dealing with transnational issues whose resolution requires multilateral cooperation .
To be sure , no large country can afford to be purely multilateralist , and sometimes the US must take the lead , as it did in Afghanistan .
But in Iraq , President Bush should have followed his father &apos;s example and built a broad international coalition .
Now , as his administration returns to the UN to seek a new resolution that will enable other countries to contribute troops and resources for peacekeeping and reconstruction in Iraq , he is paying the price for the way he went to war .
Granted , multilateralism can be used by smaller states to restrict American freedom of action , but this does not mean that it is not generally in American interests .
By embedding US policies in multilateral frameworks , America can make its disproportionate power more legitimate and acceptable .
Even well intentioned Americans are not immune to Lord Acton &apos;s famous warning that power tends to corrupt .
Learning to listen to others and to define US interests broadly to include global interests will be crucial to American soft power and whether others see the American preponderance as benign or not .
The paradox of American power is that the largest power since Rome cannot achieve many of its objectives unilaterally in a global information age .
America needs to pay more attention to soft power and to multilateral cooperation .
That is the real lesson of September 11 th .
SINGAPORE – Not a week passes , it seems , without a big ##AT##-##AT## picture thinker releasing a big ##AT##-##AT## picture book or giving a big ##AT##-##AT## picture sermon describing the gradual eclipse of American hegemony in Asia .
True , American power will inevitably decline in relative terms as Asian giants such as China and India rise .
But , at least as far as Asia is concerned , arguments about the end of American hegemony ring hollow .
For one thing , the United States was never a hegemon in Asia .
Only some American post ##AT##-##AT## Cold War triumphalists thought it was .
The nature of US power and the exercise of its influence was always much more clever and subtle than most assume .
In fact , as India and China rise , the US could actually find itself in a stronger position .
How can this be ?
After all , power and influence are built on the back of economic success .
The Chinese economy has been doubling in size every ten years since 1978 .
The Indian economy has been doing the same since 1991 .
In contrast , it takes about two decades for the US economy to double in size .
Doesn ’ t this surely mean that Asia is rushing toward a state of multi ##AT##-##AT## polarity – a configuration of roughly equal great powers balancing against each other – while American influence is on the wane ?
The seemingly obvious conclusion would be true but for the fact that Asia has a unique kind of hierarchical security system that came about partly by accident and partly by design .
No power can be preeminent if it cannot maintain its military advantage over rivals .
Yet , despite the fact that America spends more on defense than the next ten powers combined , it has never been a regional hegemon because it actually relies on the cooperation of other states to remain predominant .
Without cooperation from allies such as Japan , South Korea , Singapore , and the Philippines , the US could not retain its forward military positions in the West Pacific .
Likewise , the US needs the cooperation of Indonesia , Malaysia , and Thailand to host its critical radar infrastructure .
Moreover , in remaining preeminent , America requires other key states and regional groupings , such as ASEAN , to acquiesce in its security relationships .
Thus , there is broad ##AT##-##AT## based regional approval of US alliances with Japan , South Korea , and Australia , as well as with partners such as the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand , and India .
The key to the effectiveness of these bilateral relationships is that they enjoy widespread support ( and thus legitimacy ) in the region as stabilizing arrangements .
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts .
Combined with the raw military capacity that the US brings to the table , this means that America is powerful enough to enforce the peace and provide stability for commerce to thrive .
America ’ s presence and bilateral partnerships are complementary to Asian states ’ obsession with counter ##AT##-##AT## dominance and non ##AT##-##AT## interference in the region .
This dynamic “ liberal order ” – largely fair , flexible , and open enough to welcome new entrants as they rise – will continue to serve Asia well .
For example , even China has been a major beneficiary of the public goods provided by the US ##AT##-##AT## led hierarchical system .
This interdependent relationship means that the US is not so powerful , that it can readily ignore the wishes of key states , and it is here that its apparent weakness is actually strength .
America is not a Hobbesian Leviathan with absolute authority and power .
Indeed , China ’ s strategists are frequently puzzled by the lack of “ balancing ” that takes place against the US in the region .
But it is puzzling only if we characterize Asia as being multi ##AT##-##AT## polar rather than hierarchical .
In fact , any balancing tends to take place in order to preserve the hierarchy , not to replace or supersede it .
Other states tend to resist bids by any Asian power – be it Japan , China or India – to rise to the top of the pyramid .
As a foreign ##AT##-##AT## based power , the US needs the cooperation of Asian partners .
This keeps the top dog in check .
Were an Asian country like China to rise to the top , it would not need the same level of regional cooperation and acquiescence to maintain its position and military footholds .
As China and India rise , and Japan becomes more “ normal , ” they will balance each other within the US ##AT##-##AT## led hierarchy to ensure that the US remains on top and one or the other doesn ’ t dominate .
If China makes a bid for regional hegemony , it will find it difficult to resist the structural constraints placed on it within this hierarchy .
US power is in relative decline , but that is no bad thing .
False triumphalism breeds poor discipline .
But a sense of strategic vulnerability breeds interdependency , which has always been the key to successful US leadership in Asia .
MILAN – It is hard to be optimistic about America at present .
With the help of crucial government support in the crisis , the US financial sector ( or at least parts of it ) has bounced back , while America ’ s real economy struggles with high unemployment , discouraged labor ##AT##-##AT## force dropouts , and damaged balance sheets .
So it is no surprise that the American public and the US Congress are angry .
The focus of that anger has been the massive and unwise financial ##AT##-##AT## sector bonuses .
As a result , regulatory reforms have thus far consisted of , first , a threat to the Federal Reserve ’ s autonomy , and , second , a tax on bonuses .
The first idea is a bad one .
The latter may be politically mandatory and marginally beneficial in fiscal terms . Its effects on risk ##AT##-##AT## taking are debatable .
But the much ##AT##-##AT## needed structural reforms to limit leverage and contain the risks that the financial system periodically imposes on the real economy – and the public purse – have only belatedly gotten off the to ##AT##-##AT## do list , and the prospects of enacting them are difficult to estimate .
In fairness , the new rule proposed by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to separate financial intermediation from proprietary trading is not a bad idea .
Combined with elevated capital requirements for banks , it would reduce the chance of another simultaneous failure of all credit channels .
But it is not sufficient .
Hedge funds can also destabilize the system , as the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998 demonstrated .
So they also need clear , albeit different , limits on leverage .
Health ##AT##-##AT## care reform has deeply divided the American public and US politicians alike .
Whatever the merits and shortcomings of various proposals , these divisions suppressed the bipartisan aspects of the political process and emphasized its zero ##AT##-##AT## sum dimension .
That , in turn , has put in jeopardy other reforms .
One might expect that after a dangerous crisis rooted in growing structural imbalances and an unsustainable growth pattern on the demand side , there would be serious , ongoing debate about what is needed to restore long ##AT##-##AT## term growth and productive job creation in the context of a rapidly evolving global economy .
But there is not , which is both puzzling and worrisome .
This is not to say that the US economy has lost its dynamism .
Far from it .
But in the long term , sustaining it will require far ##AT##-##AT## sighted public policies and investments in hard and soft infrastructure to support the private sector ’ s high capacity for innovation .
There are those who disagree and believe that an economy ’ s dynamism is found almost entirely in the private sector , while the task of government is mainly to stay out of the way .
Still others accept that government could in principal do something useful , but believe that it normally does not , and that the risks outweigh the benefits .
A policy agenda in the US that is overloaded , overwhelmingly domestically focused , and partially paralyzed will mean a lack of attention to global issues that require cooperation and compromise , including the international dimensions of financial reform .
Absent coordination , there is also a risk that monetary policies designed to promote growth ( or at least not impede it ) will lead to a return of financial ##AT##-##AT## sector distortions and imbalances .
The rebalancing and restoration of global demand in the medium term is discussed within the G ##AT##-##AT## 20 , but has not really gotten underway .
From the perspectives of both policy and investment , the short and medium term is once again risky .
Many countries , including developing ones , will adopt defensive postures , some of which , such as making better use of the domestic market as a driver of growth , will have broadly positive impacts , even if growth prospects are somewhat diminished in the aggregate .
More importantly , the crisis highlighted the risks associated with high dependence on foreign capital .
That , combined with slow progress on financial ##AT##-##AT## sector reform , makes it likely that risk ##AT##-##AT## aversion will prevail , which could slow , if not reverse , financial globalization , and probably lead to slower growth in many countries .
Restarting the Doha round of trade negotiations with a more manageable agenda – and one focused on the poorer and more vulnerable developing countries – would be a good way to revive progress on trade .
But , in an environment of slow growth and high unemployment , sentiment in the advanced countries regarding efforts to liberalize trade is distinctly negative .
The restoration of growth and balance in the US economy is crucially important , not only for its effect on global growth , but also as a foundation for tackling a broad array of international problems and challenges .
Right now , it looks as though creating that foundation is on hold .
Outside the advanced countries , there is a view that the world will return to pre ##AT##-##AT## crisis conditions , with a stable US that functions as borrower , lender , and consumer of last resort .
What this perspective ignores is that pre ##AT##-##AT## crisis growth in the US and the global economy was based in part on an unsustainable configuration .
Returning to that model is neither likely nor wise .
While a relatively high and sustainable growth pattern can be achieved , it will take time .
And it will occur ( if it does ) in a global economy with fundamentally different structural and regulatory characteristics .
Waiting around for the advanced countries to right their ships so that we can all go back to the old normal is neither good policy nor a good bet .
What is needed is coordinated restructuring and policy setting .
That is hard to do when the US , the largest fiscally unified economy , is focused elsewhere .
BERKELEY – From the day after the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year , the policies followed by the United States Treasury , the US Federal Reserve , and the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have been sound and helpful .
The alternative – standing back and letting the markets handle things – would have brought America and the world higher unemployment than now exists .
Credit easing and support of the banking system helped significantly by preventing much worse .
The fact that investment bankers did not go bankrupt last December and are profiting immensely this year is a side issue .
Every extra percentage point of unemployment lasting for two years costs $ 400 billion .
A recession twice as deep as the one we have had would have cost the US roughly $ 2 trillion – and cost the world as a whole four times as much .
In comparison , the bonuses at Goldman Sachs are a rounding error .
And any attempt to make investment bankers suffer more last fall and winter would have put the entire support operation at risk .
As Fed Vice Chairman Don Kohn said , ensuring that a few thousand investment bankers receive their just financial punishment is a non ##AT##-##AT## starter when attempts to do so put the jobs of millions of Americans – and tens of millions outside the US – at risk .
The Obama administration ’ s fiscal stimulus has also significantly helped the economy .
Though the jury is still out on the effect of the tax cuts in the stimulus , aid to states has been a job ##AT##-##AT## saving success , and the flow of government spending on a whole variety of relatively useful projects is set to boost production and employment in the same way that consumer spending boosts production and employment .
And the cost of carrying the extra debt incurred is extraordinarily low : $ 12 billion a year of extra taxes would be enough to finance the fiscal ##AT##-##AT## stimulus program at current interest rates .
For that price , American taxpayers will get an extra $ 1 trillion of goods and services , and employment will be higher by about ten million job ##AT##-##AT## years .
The valid complaints about fiscal policy over the past 14 months are not that it has run up the national debt and rewarded the princes of Wall Street , but rather that it has been too limited – that we ought to have done more .
Yet these policies are political losers now : nobody is proposing more stimulus .
This is strange , because usually when something works the natural impulse is to do it again .
Good policies that are boosting production and employment without causing inflation ought to be politically popular , right ?
With respect to Obama ’ s stimulus package , it seems to me that there has been extraordinary intellectual and political dishonesty on the American right , which the press refuses to see .
For two and a half centuries , economists have believed that the flow of spending in an economy goes up whenever groups of people decide to spend more .
Sometimes spending rises because there is more disposable cash in the economy , and sometimes because changes in opportunity costs – the cost of forgoing some other action , such as saving – make people want to spend the cash they have more rapidly .
Sometimes and to some degree these increases show up as increases in prices , and sometimes and to some degree as increases in production and employment .
But , whatever the cause or effect , spending always goes up whenever groups decide to spend more – and government decisions to spend more are as good as anybody else ’ s .
They are as good as the decisions of mortgage companies and new homebuyers to spend more on new houses during the housing bubble of the mid ##AT##-##AT## 2000 ’ s , or of the princes of Silicon Valley to spend more building new companies during the dot ##AT##-##AT## com bubble of the late 1990 ’ s .
Obama ’ s Republican opponents , who claim that fiscal stimulus cannot work , rely on arguments that are incoherent at best , and usually simply wrong , if not mendacious .
Remember that back in 1993 , when the Clinton administration ’ s analyses led it to seek to spend less and reduce the deficit , the Republicans said that that would destroy the economy , too .
Such claims were as wrong then as they are now .
But how many media reports make even a cursory effort to evaluate them ?
A stronger argument , though not by much , is that the fiscal stimulus is boosting employment and production , but at too great a long ##AT##-##AT## run cost because it has produced too large a boost in America &apos;s national debt .
If interest rates on US Treasury securities were high and rising rapidly as the debt grew , I would agree with this argument .
But interest rates on US Treasury securities are very low and are not rising .
Every single Treasury auction , at which the market gobbles up huge new tranches of US Treasury debt at high prices , belies the argument that the economy has too much debt .
Those who claim that America has a debt problem , and that a debt problem cannot be cured with more debt , ignore ( sometimes deliberately ) that private debt and US Treasury debt have been very different animals – moving in different directions and behaving in different ways – since the start of the financial crisis .
What the market is saying is not that the economy has too much debt , but that it has too much private debt , which is why prices of corporate bonds are low and firms find financing expensive .
The market is also saying – clearly and repeatedly – that the economy has too little public US government debt , which is why everyone wants to hold it .
NEW YORK – The winner of America ’ s presidential election will inherit a perfect storm of problems , both economic and international .
He will face the most difficult opening ##AT##-##AT## day agenda of any president since – and I say this in all seriousness – the man who saved the Union , Abraham Lincoln .
But a more instructive precedent is 1933 , when Franklin Roosevelt offered inspiring rhetoric and “ bold experimentation ” to a nation facing economic meltdown and a breakdown in public confidence .
For me , the choice is simple – and not only because I am , by temperament and history , a Democrat .
The long and intense political campaign has revealed huge differences in the two candidates ’ positions , style , and personal qualities .
And the conclusion seems clear .
Judgment . John McCain has shown throughout his career a penchant for risk ##AT##-##AT## taking ; in his memoirs , he proudly calls himself a gambler .
His selection of Sarah Palin , a charismatic but spectacularly unqualified candidate , as his running mate , is just the most glaring of many examples of the real McCain .
His bravery in combat attests to his patriotism , courage , and toughness , but his judgment has been found sorely lacking time and time again over his career .
Barack Obama is tough , too , but in a different way .
No one should underestimate how difficult it was to travel his road , against incredible odds , to the cusp of the presidency .
But where McCain is impulsive and emotional , Obama is low ##AT##-##AT## key and unemotional .
He makes his judgments in a calm and methodical manner ; McCain ’ s impulsiveness is anathema to Obama , and rightly so – one cannot play craps with history .
Having seen so many political leaders falter under pressure , I prize this ability above most others .
And Barack Obama has it .
The economy . The first priority of the new president will be the economy and the financial crisis .
Since the crisis hit , Obama has been calm and , indeed , presidential .
He consulted the best advisory team in the nation , weighed each course of action carefully , and then issued a series of precise , calm statements .
Meanwhile , McCain has veered bizarrely , issuing contradictory statements , “ suspending ” his campaign ( while continuing to campaign ) , and urging that the first debate be canceled ( when it was all the more needed ) .
Advantage Obama .
Foreign policy . The most explicit disagreements between the candidates are over Iraq , Iran , and Russia .
But there are deeper differences .
McCain ’ s positions , with the notable exception of climate change , suggest that he would simply try to carry out George W. Bush ’ s policies more effectively .
Obama offers a different approach to foreign policy .
By starting to draw down combat troops in Iraq , Obama would change the image and policies of America immediately .
By engaging Iran in talks that would cover not only the nuclear issue but other aspects of Iran ’ s destabilizing role in the region , he would either reach agreements that lowered the dangers from Iran , or he would mobilize a stronger international coalition to isolate Iran .
Either way , engaging Iran is the right policy , and it is hard to understand why Bush and McCain have continued to hold out against such an obvious change of course , which , if carried out with firmness , will not compromise American or Israeli national security .
On Russia since its invasion of Georgia , Obama and his running mate , Joe Biden ( who was the first member of Congress to visit Georgia after the invasion ) , emphasize helping Georgia rebuild its economy and maintain its independence in the face of a continuing Russian campaign against it .
McCain , on the other hand , wants to punish Russia by such actions as expelling it from the G ##AT##-##AT## 8 .
Such measures may ultimately be necessary , but they will not help Georgia survive as an independent democracy .
Moreover , even after the outrage in Georgia , there are issues of common interest – such as energy , climate change , and Iran – on which the West and the Kremlin must cooperate .
This was true even during the Cold War , and remains true today , yet McCain seems not to recognize it .
Leadership . In the end , all presidential elections come down to the intangibles of leadership .
The vote for a president is a sort of private contract directly between each voter and his or her preferred choice .
Who do you want to see on your television screen for the next four years ?
To whom do you wish to entrust the nation ’ s fate ? &amp;
Here again , the contrasting styles of Obama and McCain offer a clear choice between a calm and confident man and a highly emotional one , between a major change in the nation ’ s direction and a minor one , between a conciliatory style and a more combative one .
Effectiveness . Finally , in a year in which the Democrats are certain to increase their majority in both houses of Congress , an Obama victory would offer the Democrats control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1994 , and with it the possibility of legislative achievement after years of stalemate .
After so many years of polarization at home and unilateralism abroad , the choice for president seems clear .
LONDON – Bipartisanship seems to have taken a drubbing in Washington since President Barack Obama got to the White House .
Like most recent American presidents , Obama campaigned on a promise to work with his political opponents for the greater good of the country .
Bill Clinton said much the same thing before he was elected , and then spent his first term in a knockdown fight with Newt Gingrich ’ s Republican majority in Congress , and his second term fighting off impeachment .
George W. Bush also said that he would reach out to those who disagreed with him .
He then turned into the most partisan and ideological president of modern times , egged on by his vice ##AT##-##AT## president , Dick Cheney .
Obama already appears to have gone further in the pursuit of bipartisanship than his predecessors .
His selection of Republicans for key posts – including retaining Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense – has raised a few eyebrows among his supporters .
But , above all , he has tried hard to secure Republican support for his efforts to prevent the economy from disappearing into a deep recessionary hole .
Only three maverick Republican Senators went along with Obama ’ s proposals to get the plan accepted .
And in the House of Representatives , the Republicans unanimously rejected every amendment , every compromise , and every courtesy that he offered .
Some commentators suggest that Obama made a bad mistake .
First , he promised bipartisanship , but got heavily rebuffed .
Second , he and his administration were so busy trying to build consensus that they watered down some of the vital ingredients of the stimulus package , and failed to defend it robustly from Republican attack .
There may sometimes be a downside in trying to woo your opponents .
When they are plainly wrong , why let them off the hook ?
Here we have had Republicans criticizing an increase in America ’ s budget deficit after doubling America ’ s national debt in the Bush presidency ’ s eight years .
Moreover , Republicans ’ belief that only tax cuts , not public spending , will delivery recovery is a sad example of blinkered ideology .
But there are more positive reasons for Obama effort at bipartisanship .
In any democratic system of checks and balances , leaders usually require coalitions in order to get what they want done .
Moreover , a consensual style is good politics .
Most voters – certainly swing voters , who usually decide elections – do not like partisan battles as much as some politicians and their supporters do .
After all , the wise , the moderate , and the floating voter do not switch on the radio to listen to archconservatives like the American broadcaster Rush Limbaugh .
When things get tough in politics , as will happen in most of the world as we struggle with the impact of the global recession , every sensible government will try to hang on to the benefit of doubt .
It is the most important attribute in politics .
Citizens know that running a country , especially in a time like this , is tough .
They are prepared to spare governments from too much criticism , if they think they are trying to do what is right for everyone .
They bridle at a government that must do unpopular things and that also looks narrow and mean ##AT##-##AT## spirited .
There is also a lot to be said for making political argument more civil .
Ronald Reagan had a strong ideological bent .
He reshaped American politics , pulling the center firmly to the right .
But he did so without ever seeming to despise his opponents or disparage their intentions .
Obama ’ s aides have confessed that he modeled his own election program on the sunny and optimistic decency of the Republican actor .
Civility in politics is not simply political confectionery .
A leader who respects his or her opponents is more likely to earn respect himself than one who doubts their patriotism and resents their criticism .
One reason for the widespread respect felt for Nelson Mandela is that years of imprisonment did not embitter him .
Jawaharlal Nehru was hugely popular because he was known to cherish free speech , take seriously the views of his critics , and defend their right to disagree with him .
His role in establishing enduring democracy in India , despite the tensions of caste , ethnicity , religion , and regional loyalties , made him one of the towering figures of the twentieth century .
So my own hope is that Obama will not be dissuaded from trying to work with his opponents , to build consensus , and to deal courteously even with those whose views he may thoroughly dislike .
Personally , I do not think that those whose philosophy deplores the whole idea of government , except when it is required to bail out businesses or banks , and who purport to offer a better future by stitching together the shreds and tatters of policies that helped produce today ’ s economic disaster , will have much respect or support from voters .
Even in Washington , there is not much to be said for being partisan , unpopular , and wrong .
LONDON – At first , it seems difficult to grasp : global capital is flowing from poor to rich countries .
Emerging ##AT##-##AT## market countries run current ##AT##-##AT## account surpluses , while advanced economies have deficits .
One would expect fast ##AT##-##AT## growing , capital ##AT##-##AT## scarce &amp; nbsp ; ( and young ) &amp; nbsp ; developing countries to be importing capital from the rest of world to finance consumption and investment .
So , why are they sending capital to richer countries , instead ?
China is a case in point .
With its current ##AT##-##AT## account surplus averaging 5.5 % of GDP in 2000 ##AT##-##AT## 2008 , China has become one of the world ’ s largest lenders .
Despite its rapid growth and promising investment opportunities , the country has persistently been sending a significant portion of its savings overseas . &amp; nbsp ;
And China is not alone .
Other emerging markets – including Brazil , Russia , India , Mexico , Argentina , Thailand , Indonesia , Malaysia , and the Middle Eastern oil exporters – have all increased their current ##AT##-##AT## account surpluses significantly since the early 1990 ’ s .
Collectively , capital ##AT##-##AT## scarce developing countries are lending to capital ##AT##-##AT## abundant advanced economies .
Many observers believe that these global imbalances reflect developing economies ’ financial integration , coupled with underdevelopment of domestic financial markets .
According to this view , these countries ’ demand for assets cannot be met – in terms of both quantity and quality – &amp; nbsp ; at home , so they deploy part of their savings to countries like the US , which can offer a more diverse array of quality assets .
While plausible , this argument suggests that , as financial markets improve over time in developing countries , the global imbalances are bound to shrink .
But such a reversal is nowhere in sight .
Why ?
A crucial dimension of globalization has been trade liberalization .
For China , foreign trade as a percentage of GDP soared from 25 % in 1989 to 66 % in 2006 , largely owing to its admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 . &amp; nbsp ;
Most of what China and other developing countries produce and export are labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive goods such as textiles and apparel .
This has allowed advanced economies , in turn , to produce and export more capital ##AT##-##AT## intensive , higher ##AT##-##AT## value ##AT##-##AT## added products .
Globalization of trade enabled countries to tap the efficiency gains that specialization in their sectors of comparative advantage has brought about .
With a slight mental stretch , one can imagine that what a country produces and trades may affect its savings and investment decisions .
An economy in which the main productive activity is berry picking , for example , has little need for investment and capital accumulation .
Its laborers earn wages , consume , and save part of that income .
Since the production process requires little capital , there is no demand for domestic investment – and thus no savings vehicles .
Instead , the only way to save is by purchasing capital abroad – in economies with capital ##AT##-##AT## intensive production and demand for investment .
This economy will always export its savings .
That may be an extreme example , but it illustrates a more general point about how merchandise trade can influence financial flows .
Countries that produce and export more labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive goods – perhaps owing to increased trade openness , or faster labor ##AT##-##AT## force and productivity growth , all of which are true of China – may experience a rise in saving , but a less ##AT##-##AT## than ##AT##-##AT## equivalent increase in demand for capital .
Rich countries , by contrast , are able to export more capital ##AT##-##AT## intensive goods , and thus have a greater need for investment .
So they may be importing more capital – resulting in a greater current ##AT##-##AT## account deficit – simply because they are producing more capital ##AT##-##AT## intensive goods .
With developing countries – in particular , China , India , and the ex ##AT##-##AT## Soviet bloc – bringing almost 1.5 billion workers into the world economy since the early 1990 ’ s , it is not difficult to understand the potential impact of this effect .
After all , much of this labor force was absorbed by labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive industries that eventually churned out products exported to the rest of the world .
Indeed , that massive addition of labor helped to drive down the relative price of labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive goods , which fell by roughly 15 % between 1989 and 2008 .
As developing countries increased their labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive production and exports , their current ##AT##-##AT## account surpluses rose – by almost 3.6 percentage points , on average , between 1989 ##AT##-##AT## 1993 and 2002 ##AT##-##AT## 2006 .
China ’ s current ##AT##-##AT## account surplus increased by almost 11 percentage points over the same period , India ’ s by 2.5 percentage points , and Russia ’ s by seven percentage points .
These countries , as well as other large surplus economies , such as Brazil , Saudi Arabia , and Iran , all experienced a simultaneous increase in the labor content of exports .
This pattern contrasts with that of the United States and many other advanced countries , which have experienced a deterioration of their current ##AT##-##AT## account balances as their production and exports have become more capital ##AT##-##AT## intensive .
Many might doubt the view that China is exporting more labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive goods , rather than upgrading its exports on the capital- and skill ##AT##-##AT## intensity ladder .
But trade data suggest the opposite , perhaps because China ’ s accession to the WTO led to tariff reductions that released more labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive production .
In fact , trade data may underestimate the true extent of China ’ s labor intensity andoverstate the capital and skill intensity of China ’ s exports .
China has witnessed rapid growth in the processing trade : assembling intermediate inputs – imported from countries like the US and Japan – that have high capital and skill content .
So , while the exports of these final goods may count towards China ’ s own capital and skill content , the country ’ s real role was only in the labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive process of assembly .
A country ’ s production structure may very well determine how much capital it supplies and how much it needs .
So the fact that capital may flow towards rich countries that produce and export more capital ##AT##-##AT## intensive goods should not be so puzzling , after all .
In a rehearsal studio , a young Cuban ballet dancer turns through the air , pivoting as though some invisible power has unfurled him in an arc .
Then , without pause , he leaps once , twice , and I gasp at the height of his grandes jetés and then gasp again because his pointed toe is heading right for a barre .
Welcome to Cuba , a country that dazzles and disappoints , where one finds miracles and monsters , but no easy answers .
Cubans recognize the contradictions as readily as any outsider .
Yet even as inflation rises and the 77 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old dictator tightens Internet access and closes the economic openings that encouraged self ##AT##-##AT## employment in the mid ##AT##-##AT## 1990 &apos;s , it is unlikely that Cubans will turn Castro out before he dies .
The rabidly anti ##AT##-##AT## Castro Cuban exiles clustered in Miami argue that it is fear that holds Cubans back , but that &apos;s not true .
A visitor in Cuba finds many ready to complain , but the palpable fear and visceral hatred rampant in El Salvador and Chile in the 1980 &apos;s is absent in today &apos;s Cuba .
Instead there is a kind of paralysis - born of a mix of loyalty , fear , and indoctrination - as they grudgingly wait for Castro to expire .
Unlike many of Latin America &apos;s freely elected governments , Castro has actually provided his constituents with public services - and without earning a reputation for corruption . &quot; All the free education and health care gives a certain balance , &quot; said a prominent writer .
&quot; Their work is less valuable , &quot; he said referring to the pesos Cubans earn in an economy sustained by dollar remittances from the foreign diaspora . But &quot; it &apos;s not a total disaster because people have this balance . &quot;
So , unlike the East Europeans who overthrew their corrupt political leaders in 1989 , and some Latin Americans who did so more recently in Bolivia , Argentina , and Ecuador , Cubans have failed to rally against Castro .
Yes , Castro jailed 75 independent journalists and others in an April sweep - that is the monster in him .
But other dissidents remain free .
That is the contradiction .
Moreover , unlike other luxury ##AT##-##AT## loving Latin American leaders , Cuban officials do not flaunt lavish lifestyles .
Among Latin American countries , only Chile and Uruguay rate better than Cuba in Transparency International &apos;s corruption index .
But this could change as dollars become hard to resist and Cubans use them to cut through ridiculous bureaucratic hurdles .
Already , the dollar has created a divide in living standards between those who have greenbacks and those who don &apos;t .
Despite a moribund economy , Castro still delivers what the majority of Latin American residents fail to get - free health care and education and a relatively drug- and crime ##AT##-##AT## free environment .
With more than 40 % of Latin America &apos;s population living in poverty , Cuba stands out as an example of a country where being poor does not mean a life of squalor .
Even World Bank president James Wolfensohn acknowledged in 2001 that Cuba had done a &quot; great job &quot; on education and health care .
More recently , in discussing the Bank &apos;s 2004 report Making Services Work for Poor People , officials put Cuba among countries like Sri Lanka , Costa Rica , and China that &quot; managed to achieve a level of outcomes in health and education that are extremely favorable . &quot;
This winter , the Cuban government reinvested some of its income from tourism in upgrading schools that deteriorated in the years following the loss of Soviet aid . &quot; Cubans are still endeared by that , &quot; said one Western diplomat .
Amazingly , many Latin America leaders fail to make the connection between reducing poverty and their own popularity .
Compare Castro &apos;s campaign to improve schools to a poverty reduction program waged by Mexico &apos;s Institutional Revolutionary Party during a six ##AT##-##AT## year period in the 1990 &apos;s .
Mexico spent 1.2 % of GDP per year to provide basic services to communities in Mexico .
According to Santa Deverajan , the director of the World Bank &apos;s World Development Report 2004 , some studies showed that the program could have reduced poverty by as much as 64 % .
Instead , the money was doled out to municipalities based on political loyalty , so poverty fell by only 3 % . &quot; If they had just given it out equally to the entire Mexican population , &quot; Deverajan says , &quot; it would have reduced poverty by 13 % . &quot;
Examples like this abound in Latin America , but it is a mistake for Castro to think that Latin America is the competition .
Cubans don &apos;t think it is .
Their touchstones are Madrid , Paris , and New York .
An educated professional with a wife and two children takes a breath when he recalls a trip to Spain . &quot; It &apos;s hard to explain how I felt when I went there .
It wasn &apos;t like another world or another planet ; it was like another galaxy . &quot;
With family in Spain , he could immigrate , but he doesn &apos;t consider that option seriously . &quot; This is where I want to live , but 5 % of the way things are run has got to change .
They blame everything on the embargo .
We have a self ##AT##-##AT## imposed embargo .
We limit ourselves . &quot;
More precisely , Castro limits Cubans .
They want to breathe , but life with a patriarchal tyrant can be suffocating .
Younger Cubans often sound like well ##AT##-##AT## educated teenagers with parents who are too strict .
They want to travel , publish what they want , dance when and where they want , and experience the world as Castro experienced it .
&quot; It &apos;s not my fight , &quot; says one 28 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old Cuban , referring to the political battle of communism versus capitalism that keeps him trapped on the island . &quot; I &apos;m a new generation .
I want to see as they had the chance to see . &quot;
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA – China ’ s current economic slowdown has no shortage of causes : Europe ’ s financial turmoil , sputtering recovery in the United States , and weak domestic investment growth , to name the most commonly cited factors .
Since exports and investment account , respectively , for 30 % and 40 % of China ’ s GDP growth , its economy is particularly vulnerable to weakening external demand and accumulation of non ##AT##-##AT## performing loans caused by excessive and wasteful spending on fixed assets .
But China ’ s vulnerability to these factors , as serious as they are , is symptomatic of deeper institutional problems .
Until these underlying constraints are addressed , talk of a new consumption ##AT##-##AT## based growth model for China , reflected in the government ’ s recently approved 12th Five ##AT##-##AT## Year Plan , can be no more than lip service .
After all , China ’ s major trading partners , international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , and senior Chinese officials themselves have long recognized the structural vulnerabilities caused by excessive investment and low household consumption .
And , for nearly a decade , China has been urged to undertake reforms to redress these economic patterns , which have undermined the welfare of ordinary Chinese and strained the global trading system .
The best ##AT##-##AT## known feature of China ’ s macroeconomic imbalances is heavy dependence on exports for growth , which is typically attributed to weak domestic demand : as a middle ##AT##-##AT## income country , China lacks the purchasing power to consume the goods that it produces .
With nearly unlimited access to advanced ##AT##-##AT## country markets , China can tap into global external demand and raise its GDP growth potential , as it has done for the past two decades .
If this view is right , the solution is straightforward : China can correct its imbalances by increasing its citizens ’ incomes ( by cutting taxes , raising wages , or increasing social spending ) , so that they can consume more , thereby reducing the economy ’ s dependence on exports .
Indeed , nearly all mainstream economists prescribe this approach for China .
But there is another explanation for China ’ s excessive export dependence , one that has more to do with the country ’ s poor political and economic institutions .
Specifically , export dependence partly reflects the high degree of difficulty of doing business in China .
Official corruption , insecure property rights , stifling regulatory restraints , weak payment discipline , poor logistics and distribution , widespread counterfeiting , and vulnerability to other forms of intellectual ##AT##-##AT## property theft : all of these obstacles increase transaction costs and make it difficult for entrepreneurs to thrive in domestic markets .
By contrast , if China ’ s private firms sell to Western multinationals , such as Wal ##AT##-##AT## Mart , Target , or Home Depot , they do not have to worry about getting paid .
They can avoid all of the headaches that they would have encountered at home , because well ##AT##-##AT## established economic institutions and business practices in their export markets protect their interests and greatly reduce transaction costs .
The Chinese economy ’ s institutional weakness is reflected in international survey data .
The World Bank publishes an annual review of “ the ease of doing business ” for 183 countries and sub ##AT##-##AT## national units .
In its June 2011 survey , China was ranked 91st , behind Mongolia , Albania , and Belarus .
It is particularly difficult to start a business in China ( 151st ) , pay taxes ( 122nd ) , obtain construction permits ( 179th ) , and get electricity ( 115th ) .
Faced with such a hostile environment , Chinese private entrepreneurs have been forced to engage in “ institutional arbitrage ” – taking advantage of efficient Western economic institutions to expand their business ( most export ##AT##-##AT## oriented businesses are owned by private entrepreneurs and foreign firms ) .
Unfortunately , as China has already claimed a large share of the world ’ s merchandise exports ( 10.4 % in 2010 ) and economic stagnation in the West is constraining external demand , this strategy can no longer work .
But reorienting their businesses toward the Chinese domestic market requires far more than government policies that put more money in consumers &apos; pockets .
In order to enjoy the same low transaction costs that they have in exporting , China ’ s entrepreneurs need a much better business environment : an effective legal system , a sound regulatory framework , a government that protects their brands by fighting intellectual ##AT##-##AT## property theft , dependable logistics and distribution networks , and a graft ##AT##-##AT## resistant bureaucracy .
China cannot create such an environment quickly .
In essence , the Chinese government must transform a predatory state into a nurturing one , and treat private entrepreneurs as creators of wealth rather than targets of extraction .
In nearly all other countries , such a transformation was accomplished by establishing the rule of law and / or moving from autocracy to democracy .
The impossibility of sustaining growth in the absence of the rule of law and political accountability presents the Chinese Communist Party with an existential dilemma .
Ever since it crushed the pro ##AT##-##AT## democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989 , the party has vowed not to surrender its political monopoly .
The investment boom and the globalization dividend of the last two decades allowed the Party to have its cake and eat it – maintaining its rule on the basis of economic prosperity , while failing to establish the institutions critical to sustaining such prosperity .
Today , this is no longer possible .
So in a sense , the Chinese bubble – as much an intellectual and political bubble as an economic one – has burst .
As China ’ s economic deceleration exposes its structural vulnerabilities and flawed policies , the much ##AT##-##AT## hyped notion of “ Chinese exceptionalism ” – that China can continue to grow without the rule of law and the other essential institutions that a modern market economy presupposes – is proving to be nothing but a delusion .
BEIJING : Continuing suppression of members of Falong Gong , a movement whose supporters continue to “ step forward ” to respond to their leader ’ s call to “ achieve consummation by facing imprisonment or death , ” provides clear evidence that something new , if inexplicable , is happening in China .
But there is a paradox here , for this “ something new ” is also something very old .
It is precisely because this mass cult ##AT##-##AT## turned ##AT##-##AT## protest ##AT##-##AT## movement has a traditional resonance that it poses such a threat to the Party establishment .
When , in April 1999 , ten thousand members of the Falun Gong sect appeared mysteriously in front of Zhongnanhai , the compound of the Chinese Communist Party ’ s leadership , to be arrested en masse , observers found it hard to explain what was going on .
The overseas press corps in Beijing was used to explaining political dissidents , student protesters , disgruntled workers and disenfranchised members of the “ floating population . ”
This mystical , crypto Buddhist / Taoist sect of middle class meditators , however , seemed to arise out of nowhere so that its origins and seriousness as a threat to China ’ s Party establishment were difficult to assess .
The group , it turned out , was led by an exiled patriarch , Li Hongzhi , who had conjured his cult out of traditional Chinese breathing exercises ( qigong ) , a belief in miracle cures , nostrums about clean living , and a mish ##AT##-##AT## mash of Buddhist and Taoist mysticism .
As wave after wave of Falun Gong supporters arrived in Tiananmen Square to be arrested , however , what began as an aberrant event became the most widespread movement of organized protest in China since 1989 .
When , like the Tianamen Square demonstrators , it met with an uncompromising government counter ##AT##-##AT## attack , it soon became obvious that , however strange and fantastic its followers might seem from the outside , Party leaders viewed the movement as a menace They labeled it a xiejiao zuzhi , literally a “ heretical ” or “ depraved ” organization , a term of denigration long ##AT##-##AT## reserved for “ unorthodox ” religious or spiritual groups based on superstition .
What makes Falun Gong so threatening is that not only is it led by a very traditionalistic leader , but that its mystical doctrine and charismatic rebelliousness evoke for Chinese an ingrained sense of historical memory of past ruling dynasties that fell after being challenged by a similar internal millenarian movement .
For Chinese , such cultic movements have deep symbolic significance because of their association with the idea of dynastic decay and collapse .
Few Chinese do not know legends and stories from history , which are passed down through the generations in novels , operas , plays and now films , comic books and even TV series .
These stories tell of how the Han Dynasty ’ s ( 206 B.C ##AT##-##AT## 422 A.D ) end was presaged by the mystical Yellow Turban Rebellion or of how the Qing Dynasty ( 1644 ##AT##-##AT## 1911 ) , China ’ s last , ran afoul of the equally mystical White Lotus and then the Boxer Rebellions .
Cult ##AT##-##AT## animated uprisings against unjust authority , with which Falun Gong is now identified , have always been viewed by Chinese as portents that political legitimacy -- sanctioned by the so ##AT##-##AT## called “ mandate of heaven ” ( tianming ) that is said to exist when “ heaven ” confers its favor on a ruling dynasty -- has been withdrawn .
For a government such as that now ruling China , one which does not derive legitimacy from the will of the people , the deeply rooted cultural presumption of ordinary people that the cosmic forces of heaven no longer shine on it , could deal a devastating psychological blow .
So , Falung Gong is viewed as an ominous threat to Party hegemony , perhaps even more ominous than any previous protest movement .
There are four reasons for this :
 because it has deep traditional and nativist Chinese roots , Falung Gong ’ s message cannot be branded as an imported and inappropriate foreign ideology in the way that notions of democracy and Christianity are dismissed by Chinese nationalists and xenophobes ;
 because the destruction of traditional Confucian values during Mao ’ s revolution and then the implosion of Marxist ideology during Deng Xiaoping ’ s economic reform era left China bereft of a coherent belief system , many Chinese are susceptible to any group that offers basic answers to questions about the meaning of life ;
 unlike student protesters who were basically rationalists and usually had clear demands to which the Party could respond ( if it wished ) , Li Hongzhi ’ s critique that contemporary Chinese life has fallen into a morass of immorality and venality brooks no easy response ;
 because this diffuse but mass ##AT##-##AT## based sect communicates with its members by word of mouth and over the Internet rather than by conventional means , it is difficult for the Party to disrupt its nerve centers .
In this sense Falun Gong is a double paradox : a traditionalistic movement freighted with deep historical symbolism , it is also a cyber ##AT##-##AT## savvy , modern Chinese protest movement .
Nothing in China ever seems to happen quite in the way China experts predict .
Virtually no expert foresaw the events of 1989 ; no expert whom I know imagined that China ’ s next wave of destabilizing protest might come from a mass movement of superstitious middle ##AT##-##AT## aged , middle ##AT##-##AT## class citizens dedicated to recycled notions of Buddhist and Taoist clean living , health through meditation , breathing exercises and mysticism spread via the Internet .
By detaining thousands of sect followers the Party may unwittingly transform an errant spiritual movement into a dangerous political force .
LONDON – Is China poised to become the world ’ s next superpower ?
This question is increasingly asked as China ’ s economic growth surges ahead at more than 8 % a year , while the developed world remains mired in recession or near ##AT##-##AT## recession .
China is already the world ’ s second largest economy , and will be the largest in 2017 .
And its military spending is racing ahead of its GDP growth .
The question is reasonable enough if we don ’ t give it an American twist .
To the American mind , there can be only one superpower , so China ’ s rise will automatically be at the expense of the United States .
Indeed , for many in the US , China represents an existential challenge .
This is way over the top .
In fact , the existence of a single superpower is highly abnormal , and was brought about only by the unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
The normal situation is one of coexistence , sometimes peaceful sometimes warlike , between several great powers .
For example , Great Britain , whose place the US is often said to have taken , was never a “ superpower ” in the American sense .
Despite its far ##AT##-##AT## flung empire and naval supremacy , nineteenth ##AT##-##AT## century Britain could never have won a war against France , Germany , or Russia without allies .
Britain was , rather , a world power – one of many historical empires distinguished from lesser powers by the geographic scope of their influence and interests . &amp; nbsp ;
The sensible question , then , is not whether China will replace the US , but whether it will start to acquire some of the attributes of a world power , particularly a sense of responsibility for global order .
Even posed in this more modest way , the question does not admit of a clear answer .
The first problem is China ’ s economy , so dynamic on the surface , but so rickety underneath .
The analyst Chi Lo lucidly presents a picture of macro success alongside micro failure .
The huge stimulus of RMB4 trillion ( $ 586 billion ) in November 2008 , mostly poured into loss ##AT##-##AT## making state ##AT##-##AT## owned enterprises via directed bank lending , sustained China ’ s growth in the face of global recession .
But the price was an increasingly serious misallocation of capital , resulting in growing portfolios of bad loans , while excessive Chinese household savings have inflated real ##AT##-##AT## estate bubbles .
Moreover , Chi argues that the crisis of 2008 shattered China ’ s export ##AT##-##AT## led growth model , owing to prolonged impairment of demand in the advanced countries .
China now urgently needs to rebalance its economy by shifting from public investment and exports towards public and private consumption .
In the short run , some of its savings need to be invested in real assets abroad , and not just parked in US Treasuries .
But , in the longer term , Chinese households ’ excessive propensity to save must be reduced by developing a social safety net and consumer credit instruments .
Moreover , to be a world economic power , China requires a currency in which foreigners want to invest .
That means introducing full convertibility and creating a deep and liquid financial system , a stock market for raising capital , and a market rate of interest for loans .
And , while China has talked of “ internationalizing ” the renminbi , it has done little so far .
“ Meanwhile , ” writes Chi , “ the dollar is still supported by the strong US political relations with most of the world ’ s largest foreign ##AT##-##AT## reserve ##AT##-##AT## holding countries . ”
Japan , South Korea , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar , and the United Arab Emirates all shelter under the US military umbrella .
The second problem is one of political values .
China ’ s further “ ascent ” will depend on dismantling such classic communist policy icons as public ##AT##-##AT## asset ownership , population control , and financial repression .
The question remains how far these reforms will be allowed to go before they challenge the Communist Party ’ s political monopoly , guaranteed by the 1978 constitution .
Two important cultural values underpin China ’ s political system .
The first is the hierarchical and familial character of Chinese political thought .
Chinese philosophers acknowledge the value of spontaneity , but within a strictly ordered world in which people know their place .
As the Analects of Confucius puts it : “ Let the ruler be a ruler , the subject a subject , a father a father , and a son a son . ”
There is also very little belief in the sanctity of human life : Buddhism holds that there is no difference between humans and animals and plants .
A pledge to protect human rights was written into the Chinese constitution in 2004 ; but , as the recent case of the blind dissident Chen Guangcheng illustrates , this is mostly a dead letter .
Similarly , private property ranks below collective &amp; nbsp ; property .
Then there is the Confucian doctrine of the “ mandate of heaven , ” by which political rule is legitimized .
Today , the mandate of Marxism has taken its place , but neither has any room for a &amp; nbsp ; mandate of the people .
Ambivalence about the source of legitimate government is not only a major obstacle to democratization , but is also a potential source of political instability .
These historical legacies limit the extent to which China will be able to share in global leadership , which requires some degree of compatibility between Chinese and Western values .
The West claims that its values are universal , and the US and Europe will not cease pressing those values on China .
It is hard to see this process going into reverse , with China starting to export its own values .
China has a choice : it can either accept Western values , or it can try to carve out an East Asian sphere to insulate itself from them .
The latter course would provoke conflict not only with the US , but also with other Asian powers , particularly Japan and India .
China ’ s best possible future thus probably lies in accepting Western norms while trying to flavor them with “ Chinese characteristics . ”
But neither choice is a scenario for China “ replacing ” the US .
Nor , I think , is this what China wants .
Its goal is respect , not dominance .
Twenty years ago , governments adopted the Montreal Protocol , a treaty to protect the Earth ’ s ozone layer from emissions of destructive chemicals .
Few could have foreseen how far ##AT##-##AT## reaching that decision would prove to be .
The Protocol explicitly aimed at phasing ##AT##-##AT## out substances such as chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) – found in products such as refrigerators , foams , and hairsprays – in order to repair the thin gassy ##AT##-##AT## shield that filters out the sun ’ s harmful , ultra ##AT##-##AT## violet rays .
By 2010 , close to 100 ozone ##AT##-##AT## depleting substances , including CFCs , will have been phased ##AT##-##AT## out globally .
Without the decisions taken 20 years ago , atmospheric levels of ozone ##AT##-##AT## depleting substances would have increased ten ##AT##-##AT## fold by 2050 .
This could have led to up to 20 million additional cases of skin cancer and 130 million more cases of eye cataracts , not to speak of damage to human immune systems , wildlife , and agriculture .
But this is only part of the story that we celebrate on the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer ( September 16 ) .
Over the past two years , it has been established that the Montreal Protocol has also spared humanity a significant level of climate change , because the gases that it prohibits also contribute to global warming .
Indeed , a study in 2007 calculated the climate mitigation benefits of the ozone treaty as totalling the equivalent of 135 billion tons of CO2 since 1990 , or a delay in global warming of 7 ##AT##-##AT## 12 years .
So the lessons learned from the Montreal Protocol may have wider significance .
Scientists now estimate that somewhere close to 50 % of climate change is being caused by gases and pollutants other than CO2 , including nitrogen compounds , low ##AT##-##AT## level ozone formed by pollution , and black carbon .
Of course , a degree of scientific uncertainty about some of these pollutants ’ precise contribution to warming remains .
But they certainly play a significant role .
Meanwhile , many of these gases need to be curbed because of their wider environmental impact on public health , agriculture , and the planet ’ s multi ##AT##-##AT## trillion dollar ecosystems , including forests .
Consider black carbon , a component of the soot emissions from diesel engines and the inefficient burning of biomass cooking stoves that is linked to 1.6 million to 1.8 million premature deaths annually as a result of indoor exposure and 800,000 as a result of outdoor exposure .
Black carbon , which absorbs heat from the sun , also accounts for anywhere from 10 % to more than 45 % of the contribution to global warming , and is also linked to accelerated losses of glaciers in Asia , because the soot deposits darken , ice making it more vulnerable to melting .
One study estimates that 26 % of black carbon emissions are from stoves for heating and cooking , with more than 40 % of this amount from wood burning , roughly 20 % from coal , 19 % from crop residues , and 10 % from dung .
Some companies have developed stoves that use passive air flows , better insulation , and 60 % less wood to reduce black carbon emissions by around 70 % .
Mass introduction of such stoves could deliver multiple green ##AT##-##AT## economy benefits .
While CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for centuries , other pollutants , including black carbon and ozone , remain for relatively periods – days , weeks , months , or years – so that reducing or ending emissions promises almost immediate climate benefits .
The international community ’ s over ##AT##-##AT## arching concern must be to seal a serious and significant deal at the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen in December to curtail C02 emissions and assist vulnerable countries to adapt .
If the world also is to deploy all available means to combat climate change , emissions of all substances that contribute to it must be scientifically evaluated and urgently addressed .
NEW YORK – With most of the world focused on economic instability and anemic growth in the advanced countries , developing countries , with the possible exception of China , have received relatively little attention .
But , as a group , emerging ##AT##-##AT## market economies have been negatively affected by the recent downturn in developed countries .
Can they rebound on their own ?
The major emerging economies were the world ’ s main growth engines following the eruption of the financial crisis in 2008 , and , to some extent , they still are .
But their resilience has always been a function of their ability to generate enough incremental aggregate demand to support their growth , without having to make up for a large loss of demand in developed countries .
A combination of negligible ( or even negative ) growth in Europe and a significant growth slowdown in the United States has now created that loss , undermining emerging economies ’ exports . Europe is a major export destination for many developing countries , and is China ’ s largest foreign market .
China , in turn , is a major market for final products , intermediate goods ( including those used to produce finished exports ) , and commodities . The ripple effect from Europe ’ s stalling economy has thus spread rapidly to the rest of Asia and beyond .
Moreover , not only is the tradable sector of Japan ’ s economy highly vulnerable to a slowdown in China , but the recent conflict over the Senkaku / Diaoyu Islands raises the prospect of economic decoupling .
Apart from that , Japanese economic performance is set to remain weak , because the non ##AT##-##AT## tradable side is not a strong growth engine .
The key questions for the world economy today , then , are how significant the growth slowdown will be , and how long it will last .
With wise policy responses , the impact is likely to be relatively mild and short ##AT##-##AT## lived .
One key issue clouding the future is trade finance .
European banks , traditionally a major source of trade finance , have pulled back dramatically , owing to capital ##AT##-##AT## adequacy problems caused by sovereign ##AT##-##AT## debt capital losses and , in some cases , losses from real ##AT##-##AT## estate lending .
This vacuum could reduce trade flows even if demand were present .
In Asia , especially , filling the vacuum with alternative financing mechanisms has become a high priority .
In particular , although China ’ s tradable sector is highly exposed to developed economies , the government is likely to accept some short ##AT##-##AT## run slowdown , rather than adopting potentially distorting stimulus measures .
Given the risk of re ##AT##-##AT## inflating asset bubbles , no one should expect a dramatic easing of credit of the type that followed the 2008 meltdown .
An accelerated public ##AT##-##AT## investment program that avoids low ##AT##-##AT## return projects is not out of the question .
But the best and most likely responses are those that accelerate domestic consumption growth by increasing household income , effectively deploy income from state ##AT##-##AT## owned assets , and strengthen China ’ s social ##AT##-##AT## security systems in order to reduce precautionary saving . Indeed , these are all key components of China ’ s recently adopted 12th Five ##AT##-##AT## Year Plan .
Admittedly , China ’ s major systemic reforms await the country ’ s leadership transition , now expected in November .
By most accounts , the pace of reform directed at expanding the market side of the economy needs to pick up quickly to achieve the ambitious economic and social goals of the next five years .
Some countries have bucked the global trend .
Indonesia , for example , has experienced accelerating growth , with rising business and consumer confidence boosting investment to almost 33 % of GDP .
Likewise , Brazil ’ s growth has been dented , but now looks set to recover . Moreover , overall economic performance in Brazil masks an important fact : growth rates have been substantially higher among the country ’ s poorer citizens , and unemployment is declining .
The aggregate growth rate does not capture this inclusiveness , and thus understates the pace of economic and social progress .
The main challenge for Brazil is to increase its investment rate from 18 % of GDP currently to closer to 25 % , thereby sustaining rapid growth and economic diversification .
Commodity dependence , even with the creation of considerable domestic value added , remains high .
Economic ##AT##-##AT## growth rates in other systemically large countries , including Turkey and Mexico , have risen as well , despite European and US headwinds .
Many African countries , too , are showing a broad pattern of sound macroeconomic fundamentals , durable growth acceleration , economic diversification , and investor confidence .
The outlook for India ’ s economy remains more uncertain .
While growth slowed recently from very high rates – owing to a combination of exposure to developed ##AT##-##AT## country weakness , internal loss of reform momentum , and declining investor confidence – that trend appears to be reversing after recent decisive corrective moves by the government .
The main question is whether India ’ s parliament will pass crucial legislation or remain paralyzed by hyper ##AT##-##AT## partisan , scandal ##AT##-##AT## fueled infighting .
Combining this general picture with more general developing ##AT##-##AT## country trends – rising incomes , rapid growth in middle classes , expanding trade and investment flows , bilateral and regional free ##AT##-##AT## trade agreements , and a growing share of global GDP ( roughly 50 % ) – these economies ’ growth momentum should return relatively rapidly , over the next 1 ##AT##-##AT## 2 years .
Most of the downside risk to this scenario lies in the systemically important economies of Europe , the US , and China .
To derail emerging economies ’ growth momentum at this stage probably would require either an additional major demand shock from the advanced economies , or some kind of failure in China ’ s leadership transition that impedes systemic reform and affects the country ’ s growth .
Notwithstanding low growth forecasts for the entire developed world , these systemic risks , taken individually and in combination , appear to be declining ( though certainly not to the point that they can be dismissed ) .
On balance , then , the multispeed growth patterns of the past decade are likely to continue .
Even as the developed economies experience an extended period of below ##AT##-##AT## trend growth , the emerging economies will remain an important growth engine .
CHICAGO – At the height of the financial crisis , the Queen of England asked my friends at the London School of Economics a simple question , but one for which there is no easy answer : Why did academic economists fail to foresee the crisis ?
Several responses to that query exist .
One is that economists lacked models that could account for the behavior that led to the crisis .
Another is that economists were blinkered by an ideology according to which a free and unfettered market could do no wrong .
Finally , an answer that is gaining ground is that the system bribed economists to stay silent .
In my view , the truth lies elsewhere .
It is not true that we academics did not have useful models to explain what happened .
If you believe that the crisis was caused by a shortage of liquidity , we had plenty of models analyzing liquidity shortages and their effects on financial institutions .
If you believe that the blame lies with greedy bankers and unthinking investors , lulled by the promise of a government bailout , or with a market driven crazy by irrational exuberance , we had studied all this too , in great detail .
Economists even analyzed the political economy of regulation and deregulation , so we could have understood why some US politicians pushed the private sector into financing affordable housing , while others deregulated private finance .
Yet , somehow , we did not bring all this understanding to bear and collectively shout our warnings .
Perhaps the reason was ideology : we were too wedded to the idea that markets are efficient , market participants are rational , and high prices are justified by economic fundamentals .
But some of this criticism of “ market fundamentalism ” reflects a misunderstanding .
The dominant “ efficient markets theory ” says only that markets reflect what is publicly known , and that it is hard to make money off markets consistently – something verified by the hit that most investor portfolios took in the crisis .
The theory does not say that markets cannot plummet if the news is bad , or if investors become risk ##AT##-##AT## averse .
Critics argue that the fundamentals were deteriorating in plain sight , and that the market ( and economists ) ignored it .
But hindsight distorts analysis .
We cannot point to a lonely Cassandra like Robert Shiller of Yale University , who regularly argued that house prices were unsustainable , as proof that the truth was ignored .
There are always naysayers , and they are often wrong .
There were many more economists who believed that house prices , though high , were unlikely to fall across the board .
Of course , these expectations could have been distorted by ideology – it is hard to get into the past minds of economists .
But there is a better reason to be skeptical of explanations relying on ideology .
As a group , neither behavioral economists , who think that market efficiency is a joke , nor progressive economists , who distrust free markets , predicted the crisis .
Could it be corruption ?
Some academic economists consult for banks or rating agencies , give speeches to investor conferences , serve as expert witnesses , and carry out sponsored research .
It would be natural to suspect us of bias .
The bias could be implicit : our worldview is shaped by what our friends in industry believe .
Or it may be an explicit bias : an economist might write a report that is influenced by what a sponsor wants to hear , or give testimony that is purely mercenary .
There are enough instances of possible bias that the issue cannot be ignored .
One remedy would be to ban all interaction between economists and the corporate world .
But if economists were confined to the ivory tower , we might be unbiased , but we would also be ignorant of practicalities – and thus even less capable of predicting problems .
One way to restore trust may be disclosure – for economists to declare a monetary interest in a particular analysis and , more generally , to explain who pays us .
A number of universities are moving in this direction .
But I believe that corruption is not the main reason that the profession missed the crisis .
Most economists have very little interaction with the corporate world , and these “ unbiased ” economists were no better at forecasting the crisis .
I would argue that three factors largely explain our collective failure : specialization , the difficulty of forecasting , and the disengagement of much of the profession from the real world .
Like medicine , economics has become highly compartmentalized – macroeconomists typically do not pay attention to what financial economists or real ##AT##-##AT## estate economists study , and vice versa .
Yet , to see the crisis coming would have required someone who knew about each of these areas – just as it takes a good general practitioner to recognize an exotic disease .
Because the profession rewards only careful , well ##AT##-##AT## supported , but necessarily narrow analysis , few economists try to span sub ##AT##-##AT## fields .
Even if they did , they would shy away from forecasting .
The main advantage that academic economists have over professional forecasters may be their greater awareness of established relationships between factors .
What is hardest to forecast , though , are turning points – when the old relationships break down .
While there may be some factors that signal turning points – a run ##AT##-##AT## up in short ##AT##-##AT## term leverage and asset prices , for example , often presages a bust – they are not infallible predictors of trouble to come .
The meager professional rewards for breadth , coupled with the inaccuracy and reputational risk associated with forecasting , leads to disengagement for most academics .
And it may well be that academic economists have little to say about short ##AT##-##AT## term economic movements , so that forecasting , with all its errors , is best left to professional forecasters .
The danger is that disengagement from short ##AT##-##AT## term developments leads academic economists to ignore medium ##AT##-##AT## term trends that they can address .
If so , the true reason why academics missed the crisis could be far more mundane than inadequate models , ideological blindness , or corruption , and thus far more worrisome ; many simply were not paying attention !
ISLAMABAD – The men who attempted to kill 14 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old Malala Yousafzai on October 9 knew what she represented .
Her active involvement since the age of eleven in campaigning for the rights of girls in her region to be educated was well known .
Malala ’ s efforts , while applauded by the West and some segments of Pakistani society , were deeply resented by the obscurantist forces that go by the name of the Taliban , which in Pakistan calls itself Tehrik ##AT##-##AT## e-Taliban Pakistan .
Their choice of name is an ironic one , for Taliban , an Arabic word , means those seeking to be educated , whereas the Taliban ’ s principal aim is to keep Muslim societies backward so that they can be persuaded to adopt a seventh ##AT##-##AT## century version of Islam .
Education , particularly of women , stands in the way of achieving this goal .
But the attack on Malala will , most likely , have an effect that is opposite to that intended by those who carried it out .
Several religious leaders joined the chorus of condemnation that followed the attack on Malala .
In a sign of unity , a council of Sunni Muslim scholars in the eastern city of Lahore issued a fatwa , signed by 50 clerics , saying that the justifications cited by the girl ’ s attackers were “ deviant ” and had no basis in Islamic law .
The Taliban seem to have been taken aback by the public and media reaction to the attack .
Dawn , Pakistan ’ s largest ##AT##-##AT## circulation English ##AT##-##AT## language newspaper , reported that Hakimullah Mehsud , the Pakistani Taliban ’ s leader , had ordered his foot soldiers to target media organizations in Karachi , Lahore , Rawalpindi , and Islamabad in response .
Several TV channels had been extremely critical of the Taliban ’ s assaults on Pakistani society .
The extremists wanted to silence the majority that was waking up to the existential threat that radical Islam poses to their country .
There is a widespread belief that Pakistani women are doing poorly when it comes to obtaining education .
That impression is correct to some extent .
The overall literacy rate for women is undoubtedly low – much lower than that for men .
But male education and literacy in Pakistan is not very high , either .
Although Pakistan is a signatory to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals , which include attainment of universal literacy for both boys and girls by 2015 , the country is far from achieving the target , with literacy rates of 70 % for boys and only 45 % for girls in 2010 .
That said , over the 17 ##AT##-##AT## year period from 1993 to 2010 , the number of girls enrolled in primary education increased from 3.7 million to 8.3 million .
This implies a rate of growth of 6.7 % a year , about 2.5 times the rate of increase in the number of girls entering the primary ##AT##-##AT## school age cohort .
But , even with this growth rate , girls still accounted for just 44.3 % of the total number of enrolled students in 2010 .
It is in higher education that Pakistani women have made extraordinary progress in recent years .
Their share of total college enrollment has increased from 36 % to 57 % over the last couple of decades , rising from less than 15,000 in 1993 to 436,000 in 2010 .
The proportion of women receiving higher education is approaching the 60 % mark , owing to an impressive 28 % annual rate of growth in their enrollment numbers in 2010 , up from a 20 % increase in 1993 .
Although a very large number of girls drop out after primary school , the number completing higher education is now large .
This year , roughly 750,000 women will graduate from Pakistan ’ s institutions of higher learning .
If the current rate of growth is maintained , by 2015 the number of women completing higher education could exceed 1.5 million a year .
Had Malala died , she eventually would have been forgotten – another victim of the war that the extremists are waging in Pakistan .
Her death would have added just one more individual to the tens of thousands who have already been killed in terrorist attacks across the country .
Malala ’ s survival – and possibly even full recovery – provides a vibrant symbol for a troubled country .
She will begin to be identified with the change that is already underway .
It is not often recognized that women in Pakistan – at least those of a certain class – are receiving the kind of education that enables them to enter the modern sectors of the economy or to become entrepreneurs .
In education , numbers make a revolution .
The extremists understand that all too well .
MILAN – Over the years , advanced and developing countries have experimented , sometimes deliberately and frequently inadvertently , with a variety of approaches to growth .
Unfortunately , many of these strategies have turned out to have built ##AT##-##AT## in limitations or decelerators – what one might call elements of unsustainability .
And avoiding serious damage and difficult recoveries requires us to get a lot better at recognizing these self ##AT##-##AT## limiting growth patterns early on .
Here are some of the items in a growing library of decelerating growth models .
In developing countries , import substitution as a way to jump ##AT##-##AT## start economic diversification can work for a while ; but , over time , as productivity growth lags and comparative advantage is over ##AT##-##AT## ridden , growth grinds to a halt .
Small , open economies are naturally somewhat specialized , which leaves them vulnerable to shocks and volatility .
But , in terms of growth and living standards , the cost of economic diversification , when implemented by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition , eventually outweighs the benefits .
It is better to allow specialization , and build effective social safety nets and support systems to protect people and families during economic transitions .
Such “ structural flexibility ” is better adapted to enabling the broad changes that rapidly evolving technological and global economic forces require .
Mismanagement of natural ##AT##-##AT## resource wealth underpins an especially potent self ##AT##-##AT## limiting pattern of growth and development .
If invested in infrastructure , education , and external financial assets , natural ##AT##-##AT## resource revenues can accelerate growth .
But , too often , such revenues distort economic incentives , which come to favor rent ##AT##-##AT## seeking and interfere with the diversification that is essential for growth .
More recently , many advanced countries have discovered a “ new ” set of growth models with built ##AT##-##AT## in structural limitations : excessive private or public consumption , or both , usually accompanied and enabled by rising debt and inflated asset prices , and a corresponding decline in investment .
This approach appears to work until domestic aggregate demand can no longer sustain growth and employment , at which point it ends in either gradual stagnation or a violent financial and economic crisis .
( In fact , many developing countries have learned this the hard way , but the lessons seem not to have crossed over to advanced countries . )
But the opposite of the excessive ##AT##-##AT## consumption model – excessive reliance on investment to generate aggregate demand – is also a self ##AT##-##AT## limiting growth pattern .
When the private and social returns of investment diminish too much , growth cannot be sustained indefinitely , even though rising investment rates can sustain aggregate demand for a while .
Altering this growth pattern is a significant part of the challenge that China now faces .
Rising inequality in either opportunity or outcomes ( and often both ) also poses threats to the sustainability of growth patterns .
While people in a wide range of countries accept some degree of market ##AT##-##AT## determined income variation , based on differential talents and personal preferences , there are limits .
When they are breached , the typical result is a sense of unfairness , followed by resistance and , ultimately , political choices that address the inequality , though sometimes in counter ##AT##-##AT## productive , growth ##AT##-##AT## impeding ways .
Perhaps the largest long ##AT##-##AT## run sustainability issue concerns the adequacy of the global economy ’ s natural ##AT##-##AT## resource base : output will more than triple over the coming two or three decades , as high ##AT##-##AT## growth developing economies ’ four billion people converge toward advanced ##AT##-##AT## country income levels and consumption patterns .
Existing economic ##AT##-##AT## development strategies will require significant adaption to accommodate this kind of growth .
Some adaptation will occur naturally , as rising energy and other commodity prices generate incentives to economize or seek alternatives .
But the un ##AT##-##AT## priced environmental externalities – global warming and water depletion , for example – will require serious attention , not myopic , reactive mindsets and approaches . &amp; nbsp ;
All of these self ##AT##-##AT## limiting growth patterns tend to have three things in common . First , in one or several dimensions , some part of the economy ’ s base of tangible , intangible , and natural ##AT##-##AT## resource assets is being run down .
I would include social cohesion as part of the asset base : it is the one that is depreciated by excessive inequality .
Measurement issues play an important role here .
It is easier to run down something that is partly invisible because it is not regularly or effectively measured .
Expanded measurement of the dimensions of economic , social , and environmental performance is necessary to broaden awareness of sustainability issues . &amp; nbsp ;
Second , unidentified self ##AT##-##AT## limiting growth patterns produce very bad results .
Expectations come to exceed reality , and resetting the system to a sustainable growth pattern is difficult .
After all , past investment shortfalls have to be made up and future ##AT##-##AT## oriented investments undertaken simultaneously – a double burden that must be borne by the current generation .
An inability to resolve the distributional and fairness problem can produce gridlock , paralysis , and prolonged stagnation .
Finally , many of these flawed growth patterns involve fiscal distress .
Contrary to the prevailing wisdom nowadays , some degree of Keynesian demand management in the transition to a more sustainable growth pattern is not in conflict with restoring fiscal balance over a sensible time period .
On the contrary , applied both individually and together , fiscal stimulus and consolidation are necessary parts of the adjustment process .
But they are not sufficient .
The crucial missing pieces are a shift in the structure of accessible aggregate demand and restoration of those parts of the economy ’ s asset base that have been run down , implying the need for structural change and investment .
WASHINGTON , DC – In recent decades , economists have been struggling to make use of the concept of human capital , often defined as the abilities , skills , knowledge , and dispositions that make for economic success . Yet those who use the term often assume that to conceptualize a phenomenon is a first step to manipulating it .
Simon Kuznets , one of the twentieth century ’ s great economists , was a pioneer of human ##AT##-##AT## capital theory . Not long before he died , Kuznets recommended to a young colleague that one ought study the role of Jews in economic life .
By and large , economists and other social scientists have neglected the history of Jews and capitalism , for reasons that are understandable , though unconvincing . For most economists , the extent to which modern capitalism has been shaped by earlier cultural predispositions is a source of puzzlement at best , if not merely a factor to be dismissed .
When economists examine “ human capital , ” they prefer measurable criteria such as years of schooling . To the extent that human capital involves character traits and varieties of “ know ##AT##-##AT## how ” that are transmitted within the realms of the family and the community , rather than by formal education , it becomes both methodologically elusive and difficult to manipulate by public policy .
A look at the historical experience of the Jews shows that while most Jews were mired in poverty at the beginning of the twentieth century , over time they tended to do disproportionately well in societies that allowed them to compete on an equal basis . That was the case first in central and western Europe , and then in the United States .
In search of economic niches not already occupied by others , Jews frequently created markets for new products and services . They pioneered new retail institutions , from department stores to box stores .
The fastest growing sectors of the economy since the late nineteenth century have been those loosely classified as “ service industries , ” often involving the dissemination of information and entertainment – activities in which Jews have been especially prominent , from publishing to vaudeville and from movies to commercial sports . They also tended to do disproportionately well in the learned professions – such as medicine , law , and accounting – that are so central to modern capitalist society .
The fact that Jews were long a minority subject to discrimination is sometimes given as a reason for their tendency to devote themselves to commerce , finance , and the professions . Yet not all minorities long subject to discrimination necessarily succeed under conditions of market competition .
There are a number of ways to account for Jews ’ disproportionate achievement . For one thing , Jews had more experience with commerce than most other groups , and the tacit knowledge of buying , selling , and calculating advantage that was passed on in families with ties to business helps explain why Jews tended to be better at it .
Moreover , in much of Europe , Jews had long been excluded from most of the established economy of land ownership , and from many other fields that were reserved for Christians . So they learned to be on the lookout for new opportunities in underserved markets , working as peddlers , for example , or creating new products , or new forms of marketing .
Jews were spread across many countries , but to some extent shared a common language and a sense of common fate . So they were more aware of distant opportunities , had more international contacts , and were disproportionately active in international trade .
In addition , Jews had a religious culture that promoted universal adult literacy – at least for men – and a culture that respected book learning . Those attitudes and dispositions were transferred from religious texts to secular forms of education .
Such factors provide a sense of why attention to the history of Jews under capitalism helps us to understand capitalism more generally . It reminds us that much of success in a capitalist society is based on cultural and historical factors that produce qualities such as innovativeness , willingness to tolerate risk , and willingness to defer gratification through savings and education .
These cultural traits are difficult to quantify , so economists are uncomfortable in dealing with them . They are often passed down within families , so they elude social policies that are based on the notion that equality of opportunity can be created by government action .
Exploring the economic history of the Jews also reminds us that groups that are disproportionately successful are met by different political reactions . Societies long oriented to economic dynamism tend to welcome the economically successful , viewing them as a source of mutual gains .
But cultures that tend to resent the economically successful – either as an affront to equality , or on the implicit assumption that the economic gains of some must be at the expense of others – tend to be more hostile toward Jews and given to conspiratorial theories to explain their economic success . Most societies lie somewhere along a spectrum between these two poles .
Some social scientists are wary of calling attention to the reality of disproportionate Jewish economic success for fear of arousing anti ##AT##-##AT## Semitism , or contributing to conspiratorial theories about Jewish economic dominance . No doubt , conspiratorial minds will always find fodder for their obsessions .
EDINBURGH – People with higher intelligence test scores in childhood and early adulthood tend to live longer .
This result has been found among people from Australia , Denmark , England and Wales , Scotland , Sweden , and the United States . In fact , it has been found within every population that has been studied .
Indeed , the impact of intelligence on mortality rivals well ##AT##-##AT## known risk factors for illness and death , such as high blood pressure , being overweight , high blood glucose , and high cholesterol .
Its effect is almost as important as that of smoking .
Differences in human intelligence have environmental and genetic causes .
An intelligence test score in early life is partly a record of what the environment has wrought on the brain and the rest of the body up to that time .
Babies who have lower birth weights , for example , are more prone to chronic illnesses later in life .
They also have , on average , slightly lower intelligence .
But tests of whether birth weight might explain some of the link between intelligence and mortality have found no connection .
Parents ’ occupations are also related to their child ’ s intelligence and later risk of illness : children from more privileged backgrounds tend to have higher intelligence and better health , and to live longer .
However , there is no convincing evidence that parental background explains the link between higher intelligence and longer life .
Other researchers have viewed intelligence test scores as possibly more than just an indicator of an efficient brain .
After all , the brain is just one organ of the body , so people whose brains work well in early life may also have other organs and systems that are more efficient than others ’ .
But this “ system integrity ” idea is somewhat vague and difficult to test .
The best we have done to date has been to examine whether people ’ s reaction speeds are related to intelligence and to mortality .
They are .
Reaction ##AT##-##AT## time tests involve little thinking , and merely ask people to respond as fast as they can to simple stimuli .
People who react faster have , on average , higher intelligence scores and live longer .
But we need to think of better measures of the body ’ s integrity to test this idea more fully .
A third potential explanation is that intelligence is about good decision ##AT##-##AT## making .
Every day , as we live our lives , we make decisions about our health : what , when , and how much to eat ; how much exercise to take ; how to look after ourselves if we have an illness ; and so forth .
Therefore , the reason that intelligence and death are linked might be that people with higher intelligence in childhood make better decisions about health , and have healthier behaviors .
As adults , they tend to have better diets , exercise more , gain less weight , have fewer hangovers , and so on .
So far , so good .
But we do not yet have the full story .
There have not been any studies with data on childhood intelligence , lots of subsequent data on adult health behaviors , and then a long ##AT##-##AT## term follow ##AT##-##AT## up for deaths .
And only such a study could tell us whether it is these healthy behaviors that explain the link between intelligence and death .
A fourth type of explanation is that people with higher intelligence in childhood tend to attain better educational qualifications , work in more professional jobs , have higher incomes , and live in more affluent areas .
These variables are related to living longer , too .
So , perhaps that ’ s it : higher intelligence buys people into safer and more health ##AT##-##AT## friendly environments .
Certainly , in some studies , social class in adulthood seems to explain a lot of the link between intelligence and death .
The problem is that this “ explanation ” is statistical .
We are still not sure whether , say , education and occupation “ explain ” the effect of intelligence on health , or whether they are , in effect , merely surrogate measures of intelligence .
Researchers have also searched for clues about the intelligence ##AT##-##AT## mortality link in specific types of death .
This has been revealing .
Lower intelligence in early life is associated with a greater likelihood of dying from , for example , cardiovascular disease , accidents , suicide , and homicide .
The evidence for cancer is less certain .
As we have come across these specific findings , we have realized that each link might need a different explanation .
Finally , we know that how intelligent we are and how long we shall live are caused by both environmental and genetic influences .
There are experimental designs , using twins , that can find out the extent to which intelligence and mortality are linked because they share environmental and genetic influences .
Among the most informative exercises we can undertake in cognitive epidemiology is to obtain a large group of twins on whom there is data on early ##AT##-##AT## life intelligence and who were tracked for a long time to find out who had died .
We haven ’ t yet come across a large enough group of twins with such data .
Finding one is a priority .
The ultimate aim of this research is to find out what intelligent people have and do that enables them to live longer .
Once we know that , we will be able to share and apply that knowledge with the aim of achieving optimal health for all .
Pain is a familiar experience for everyone , but its nature remains a troubling enigma for sufferers and scientists alike .
Why do different patients who undergo the same surgical procedure experience markedly different post ##AT##-##AT## operative pain ?
How is it that people with little or no medical explanation for a persistent pain become partially or totally disabled by it , even with extensive and resourceful treatment ?
Many doctors would like to think of pain as a simple sensation that usefully calls disease or injury to our attention .
But pain resists explanation as a simple sensation , just as music resists explanation as simple tones .
A contemporary non ##AT##-##AT## medical writer described the qualities of intense pain as including extreme unpleasantness , an ability to annihilate complex thoughts and other feelings , an ability to destroy language , and a strong resistance to objectification .
She reminds physicians that , for the person suffering intense pain , what dominates awareness above all else is a powerful negative emotion .
Most of the time , pain occurs after simple nerve endings detect tissue injury in various ways and generate signals that travel to the spinal cord and from there to the brain .
For many years , scientists thought that these signals traveled along a few well ##AT##-##AT## defined routes to reach a relay station in the brain called the thalamus .
From there , scientists believed , the signals went on to the part of the brain &apos;s cortex that managed body awareness , and somehow the cortex turned them into conscious experience .
Unfortunately , the neural roadmap for sensory messages of tissue injury explains only a part of how we experience pain .
It cannot explain why pain involves emotion and cognition .
Psychologists are quick to point out that whenever humans experience strong emotions , cognitions--thoughts , memories , expectations , beliefs , and interpretation of the situation--help form the experience .
In other words , pain may begin with a neural message of tissue injury or disease , but it is the end product of complex events within the brain .
The conscious experience of pain involves emotion and cognition as well as sensation .
We always experience pain as a distressing thing happening in some part of the body , in some particular circumstance , and usually it has a particular meaning .
New evidence points to more complex mechanisms for pain that involve higher levels of the brain .
Injury messages , it seems , travel to many brain structures , not just to sensation ##AT##-##AT## generating areas .
Some injury messages directly excite brain structures that produce emotion , and these in turn stimulate areas of the brain that create the meaning of the immediate situation .
Pain emerges into awareness only after sensory , emotional , and cognitive processes have combined to form a coherent , integrated pattern of experience .
Studies of functional brain imaging in people experiencing pain tend to confirm this view .
As we might expect , sensation ##AT##-##AT## generating areas are active , but so are structures in emotion ##AT##-##AT## generating areas of the brain and structures related to attention and thinking .
Even motor structures that enable so ##AT##-##AT## called &quot; fight or flight &quot; responses to a dangerous situation become active .
Such studies show that simple signals of tissue injury generate many simultaneous brain processes .
These processes combine to produce the private and unpleasant bodily awareness that we call pain .
Because emotions and cognitions are an intrinsic part of the experience of pain , people differ greatly in their responses to a common injury , such as a standard surgical operation .
Individual memory , beliefs , cultural background , and personal meaning all shape pain , so that an injury that is horrible to one person can be a minor discomfort to another .
Psychological researchers are beginning to investigate why individual patients form the experience of pain differently when they experience similar tissue injury .
Why seemingly healthy body areas can hurt persistently , and thereby disable a person , still eludes explanation .
Some researchers are finding that long ##AT##-##AT## lasting injury signals in neural pathways can change the way those pathways function , and over long periods of time , relentless signals of injury can even alter neural structures themselves .
The altered parts of the nervous system might keep generating injury messages , even after the original injury has healed .
Other researchers apply the same principle to higher levels of the brain .
Memory of tissue injury rather than new messages of injury might contribute to the formation of pain , and in this way the brain might continuously create pain in the absence of its original cause .
Alternatively , the brain might turn minor signaling of tissue injury into a major pain by mixing cognitive and emotional memories into the formation of the pain experience .
Research on pain is progressing on many fronts .
Perhaps the most challenging is that of understanding how the brain integrates sensory , emotional , and cognitive processes when an injury occurs to form the complex bodily awareness that we know as pain .
Unlocking this secret may help doctors prevent , treat , or eliminate some chronic pain disorders .
CAMBRIDGE – In the French parliament ’ s recent debate on Europe ’ s new fiscal treaty , the country ’ s Socialist government vehemently denied that ratification of the treaty would undermine French sovereignty .
It places “ not one constraint on the level of public spending , ” Jean ##AT##-##AT## Marc Ayrault , the prime minister , asserted . “ Budget sovereignty remains in the parliament of the French Republic . ”
As Ayrault was trying to reassure his skeptical colleagues , including many members of his own party , European Commissioner for Competition Joaquin Almunia was delivering a similar message to his fellow social democrats in Brussels .
To succeed , he argued , Europe must prove wrong those who believe there is a conflict between globalization and sovereignty .
Nobody likes to give up national sovereignty , least of all , it seems , politicians on the left .
Yet , by denying the obvious fact that the eurozone ’ s viability depends on substantial restraints on sovereignty , Europe ’ s leaders are misleading their voters , delaying the Europeanization of democratic politics , and raising the political and economic costs of the ultimate reckoning .
The eurozone aspires to full economic integration , which entails the elimination of transaction costs that impede cross ##AT##-##AT## border commerce and finance .
Obviously , it requires that governments renounce direct restrictions on trade and capital flows .
But it also requires that they harmonize their domestic rules and regulations – &amp; nbsp ; such as product ##AT##-##AT## safety standards and bank regulations – with those of other member states in order to ensure they do not act as indirect trade barriers . And governments must forswear changes in these policies , lest the uncertainty itself act as a transaction cost .
This was all implicit in the European Union ’ s single ##AT##-##AT## market initiative .
The eurozone went one step further , aiming through monetary unification to eradicate fully the transaction costs associated with national currencies and exchange ##AT##-##AT## rate risk .
Simply put , the European integration project has hinged on restrictions on national sovereignty .
If its future is now in doubt , it is because sovereignty stands in the way once again .
In a true economic union , underpinned by union ##AT##-##AT## wide political institutions , the financial problems of Greece , Spain , and the others would not have blown up to their current proportions , threatening the existence of the union itself .
Consider the United States .
No one even keeps track of , say , Florida ’ s current ##AT##-##AT## account deficit with the rest of the country , although we can safely guess that it is huge ( since the state is home to many retirees living off benefits that come from elsewhere ) .
When Florida ’ s state government goes bankrupt , Florida ’ s banks continue to operate normally , because they are under federal rather than state jurisdiction .
When Florida ’ s banks go belly ##AT##-##AT## up , state finances are insulated , because the banks are ultimately the responsibility of federal institutions .
When Florida ’ s workers become unemployed , they get unemployment checks from Washington , DC .
And when Florida ’ s voters are disenchanted about the economy , they do not riot outside the state capital ; they put pressure on their representatives in Congress to push for changes in federal policies .
Nobody would argue that US states have an abundance of sovereignty .
The relationship between sovereignty and democracy is also misunderstood .
Not all restrictions on the exercise of sovereign power are undemocratic .
Political scientists talk about “ democratic delegation ” – the idea that a sovereign might want to tie its hands ( through international commitments or delegation to autonomous agencies ) in order to achieve better outcomes .
The delegation of monetary policy to an independent central bank is the archetypal example : in the service of price stability , daily management of monetary policy is insulated from politics .
Even if selective limitations on sovereignty may enhance democratic performance , there is no guarantee that all limitations implied by market integration would do so .
In domestic politics , delegation is carefully calibrated and restricted to a few areas where the issues tend to be highly technical and partisan differences are not large .
A truly democracy ##AT##-##AT## enhancing globalization would respect these boundaries .
It would impose only those limits that are consistent with democratic delegation , possibly along with a limited number of procedural norms ( such as transparency , accountability , representativeness , use of scientific evidence , etc . ) that enhance democratic deliberation at home .
As the American example illustrates , it is possible to give up on sovereignty – &amp; nbsp ; as Florida , Texas , California , and the other US states have done – &amp; nbsp ; without giving up on democracy .
But combining market integration with democracy requires the creation of supranational political institutions that are representative and accountable .
The conflict between democracy and globalization becomes acute when globalization restricts the domestic articulation of policy preferences without a compensating expansion of democratic space at the regional / global level .
Europe is already on the wrong side of this boundary , as the political unrest in Spain and Greece indicates .
That is where my political trilemma begins to bite : We cannot have globalization , democracy , and national sovereignty simultaneously .
We must choose two among the three .
If European leaders want to maintain democracy , they must make a choice between political union and economic disintegration .
They must either explicitly renounce economic sovereignty or actively put it to use for the benefit of their citizens .
The first would entail coming clean with their own electorates and building democratic space above the level of the nation ##AT##-##AT## state .
The second would mean giving up on monetary union in order to be able to deploy national monetary and fiscal policies in the service of longer ##AT##-##AT## term recovery .
The longer this choice is postponed , the greater the economic and political cost that ultimately will have to be paid .
BRUSSELS – The emerging consensus in Europe nowadays is that only “ debt mutualization ” in the form of Eurobonds can resolve the euro crisis , with advocates frequently citing the early United States , when Alexander Hamilton , President George Washington ’ s treasury secretary , successfully pressed the new federal government to assume the Revolutionary War debts of America ’ s states .
But a closer look reveals that this early US experience provides neither a useful analogy nor an encouraging precedent for Eurobonds .
First , taking over a stock of existing state debt at the federal level is very different from allowing individual member states to issue bonds with “ joint and several ” liability underwritten by all member states collectively .
Hamilton did not have to worry about moral hazard , because the federal government did not guarantee any new debt incurred by the states .
Second , it is seldom mentioned that US federal debt at the time ( around $ 40 million ) was much larger than that of the states ( about $ 18 million ) .
Thus , assuming state debt was not central to the success of post ##AT##-##AT## war financial stabilization in the new country ; rather , it was a natural corollary of the fact that most of the debt had been incurred fighting for a common cause .
Moreover , the most efficient sources of government revenues at the time were tariffs and taxes collected at the external border .
Even from an efficiency point of view , it made sense to have the federal government service public debt .
Federal assumption of the states ’ war debts also yielded an advantage in terms of economic development : once states no longer had any debt , they had no need to raise any revenues through direct taxation , which might have impeded the growth of America ’ s internal market .
Indeed , after the federal government assumed the states ’ debt ( already a small part of the total ) , state revenues fell by 80 ##AT##-##AT## 90 % .
The states then became for some time fiscally irrelevant .
Finally , the key to the success of financial stabilization was a profound restructuring .
Hamilton estimated that the federal government could raise enough revenues to pay approximately 4 % interest on the total amount of debt to be serviced – significantly less than the 6 % yield on the existing obligations .
Holders of both state and federal bonds were thus offered a basket of long ##AT##-##AT## dated bonds , some with an interest rate of 3 % , and others with 6 % ( with a ten ##AT##-##AT## year grace period ) .
The basket was designed in such a way as to result in an average debt ##AT##-##AT## service cost of 4 % .
In modern terms , the “ net present value ” of the total debt ( federal and state ) was reduced by about one ##AT##-##AT## half if one were to apply the usual exit yield of 9 % .
Moreover , the new federal bonds ’ very long maturities meant that there was no rollover risk .
It would have been very dangerous to expose the federal government to this danger , given that the operation was rightly perceived at the outset as extremely risky .
For the country ’ s first few years , debt service swallowed more than 80 % of all federal revenues .
The slightest negative shock could have bankrupted the new federal government .
Fortunately , the opposite happened : federal revenues tripled under the impact of a rapid post ##AT##-##AT## war reconstruction boom , and continued to grow rapidly , aided by the country ’ s ability to remain neutral while wars ravaged the European continent .
By contrast , growth prospects in Europe today are rather dim , and interest payments , even for Greece or Italy , account for less than 20 % of total revenues .
The real problem is the rollover of existing debt in a stagnating economy .
For example , Italy will soon have a balanced budget in structural terms , but must still face the problem of refinancing old debt as it matures each year .
Assuaging doubt about the sustainability of public debt in the eurozone would thus probably require a deep restructuring as well .
The eurozone crisis could certainly be resolved if all existing public debt were transformed into 20 ##AT##-##AT## year Eurobonds with a yield of 3 % , and a five ##AT##-##AT## year grace period on debt service .
One can easily anticipate the impact that this would have on financial markets .
More interesting in view of the current situation in the eurozone is what followed roughly a half ##AT##-##AT## century after Hamilton acted .
In the 1830 ’ s and 1840 ’ s , a number of states had over ##AT##-##AT## invested in the leading transport technology of the time – &amp; nbsp ; canals .
When the canal ##AT##-##AT## building boom ended , eight states and the Territory of Florida ( accounting for about 10 % of the entire US population at the time ) were unable to service their debt and defaulted on their , mostly British , loans .
British bankers threatened that they would never again invest in these untrustworthy Americans .
They could point to the precedent set by Hamilton , and had probably invested on the implicit understanding that , if necessary , the federal government would bail out the states again .
But , despite foreign creditors ’ threats , the federal government did not come to the rescue .
The bailout request did not succeed because it could not muster a simple majority of the states ( represented by the Senate ) and the population ( represented by the House of Representatives ) under the normal decision ##AT##-##AT## making procedure ( the “ Community method , ” in European Union jargon ) .
The defaults proved to be costly .
The 1840 ’ s were a period of slow growth , and continued pressure from foreign creditors forced most of the official debtors to resume payments after a while .
Default was not an easy way out , and all US states ( with the exception of Vermont ) have since embraced balanced ##AT##-##AT## budget amendments to their constitutions as a way to shore up their fiscal credibility .
Are EU members prepared to take a similar step ?
The World Bank , the Open Society Institute , and the European Commission are co ##AT##-##AT## sponsoring a conference , Roma in an Expanding Europe : Challenges for the Future , from June 30 ##AT##-##AT## July 1 in Budapest , with the Government of Hungary as host .
Here , the President of the World Bank and the Chairman of the OSI discuss the problems that must be addressed .
Too often in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , Roma teens and children spend their days at the garbage dump .
Unable to afford school , they scavenge for paper and other scraps for recycling , earning just enough to eat .
Too often Roma families live in tiny cramped wooden or tin shacks with no power or running water and dim prospects for the future .
A similar picture , though on a smaller scale , exists in many European Union member countries that are home to Roma minorities .
A wide socioeconomic disparity exists between Europe &apos;s majority population and Roma , or &quot; Gypsies &quot; , many of whom live in extreme poverty .
Left unchanged , this persistent poverty threatens to become a permanent drag on European prosperity , which would be a tragedy for Roma and non ##AT##-##AT## Roma alike .
The situation of the 7 ##AT##-##AT## 9 million Roma living on the continent deserves the urgent attention of government leaders as they shape the policies of an enlarged EU .
Roma are the continent &apos;s fastest growing and most vulnerable minority .
Boosting their prospects will be crucial to sustained prosperity on the continent , and will require implementing inclusive policies to ensure that Roma enjoy the post ##AT##-##AT## transition benefits of open , free ##AT##-##AT## market economies .
Indeed , Roma have been among the biggest losers in the transition from communism since 1989 .
They were often the first to lose their jobs in the early 1990 &apos;s , and they have been persistently blocked from reentering the labor force due to their often inadequate skills and pervasive discrimination .
Even in the more prosperous countries of Central and Eastern Europe , Roma poverty is strikingly high--sometimes more than ten times that of non ##AT##-##AT## Roma .
While accession countries such as Hungary , the Czech Republic , and Slovakia have made impressive progress in economic and political transformation during the 1990 &apos;s , dealing with the plight of the Roma remains one of the most critical issues on their path to EU membership next year and over the next decade .
In 2000 , nearly 80 % of Roma in Bulgaria and Romania were living on less than $ 4.30 per day , in comparison with 37 % of the total population of Bulgaria and 30 % in Romania .
In better ##AT##-##AT## off Hungary , 40 % of Roma were living on incomes below this level , compared with 7 % of the non ##AT##-##AT## Roma population .
Poverty , combined with higher birth rates , means that the magnitude of Roma hardship will grow in coming years .
Roughly 25 ##AT##-##AT## 30 % of Roma are under 15 years of age , in contrast with 10 % of the majority population .
High unemployment , particularly among young people , locks Roma in a vicious cycle of impoverishment and exclusion , further driving down living standards and leaving many in marginalized settlements without access to electricity , clean water , or other basic utilities .
Lack of education keeps Roma out of work and limits their future opportunities .
An estimated 600,000 Roma children of primary school age living in the EU accession countries are not attending school at all .
Of those that go , most do not complete primary school , and less than 1 % across Central and Eastern Europe go on to higher education .
Many students who are in class are stuck in inferior segregated schools .
Others are wrongly placed in schools for the mentally and physically disabled , merely because they had no access to preschool , or because they do not speak the majority language .
Nonetheless , there is reason for optimism .
Over the past decade , a range of initiatives have been launched to keep Roma children in school , expand access to jobs , and overcome discrimination .
While such interventions by governments , non ##AT##-##AT## government groups and international agencies have helped , the time has now come to scale up the effort .
Most importantly , a small but growing core of experienced and dedicated young Roma leaders is emerging who can work both within their communities and with governments to overcome poverty and discrimination .
At the end of this month , many of these young people will join us in Budapest , along with Prime Ministers and other senior officials from Central and Eastern European countries and EU member states .
For the first time , government and Roma leaders will tackle the Roma issue as a core social and economic concern .
Such an integrated policy approach is needed to ensure that the basic rights of Roma are truly realized in an expanded Europe .
We cannot afford to leave the Roma behind .
LONDON – Historically , the term “ fair trade ” has meant many things .
The Fair Trade League was founded in Britain in 1881 to restrict imports from foreign countries . In the United States , businesses and labor unions use “ fair trade ” laws to construct what economist Joseph Stiglitz calls “ barbed ##AT##-##AT## wire barriers to imports . ”
These so called “ anti ##AT##-##AT## dumping ” laws allow a company that suspects a foreign rival of selling a product below cost to request that the government impose special tariffs to protect it from “ unfair ” competition .
Such dark protectionist thoughts are far from the minds of the benevolent organizers of the United Kingdom ’ s annual “ Fairtrade Fortnight , ” during which I just bought two bars of fair ##AT##-##AT## trade chocolate and a jar of fair ##AT##-##AT## trade chunky peanut butter .
Their worthy aim is to raise the price paid to developing ##AT##-##AT## country farmers for their produce by excluding the inflated profits of the middlemen on whom they depend for getting their goods to distant markets .
Fair ##AT##-##AT## trade products like cocoa , coffee , tea , and bananas do not compete with domestic European production , and therefore do not have a protectionist motive .
This is how it works : In exchange for being paid a guaranteed price and meeting “ agreed labor and environmental standards ” ( minimum wages , no pesticides ) , poor ##AT##-##AT## country farming cooperatives receive a FAIRTRADE mark for their products , issued by the FAIRTRADE Labeling Organization .
This certification enables supermarkets and other retailers to sell the products at a premium .
Third ##AT##-##AT## world farmers get a boost to their income , while first ##AT##-##AT## world consumers get to feel virtuous : a marriage made in heaven .
The fair ##AT##-##AT## trade movement , launched in the 1980 ’ s , has been growing rapidly .
In a notable breakthrough in 1997 , the British House of Commons decided to serve only fair ##AT##-##AT## trade coffee .
By the end of 2007 , more than 600 producers ’ organizations , representing 1.4 million farmers in 58 countries , were selling fair ##AT##-##AT## trade products .
Today , a quarter of all bananas in UK supermarkets are sold under a FAIRTRADE mark .
But FAIRTRADE ##AT##-##AT## labeled products still represent a very small share – typically less than 1 % – of global sales of cocoa , tea , coffee , etc .
The economic rationale for guaranteed prices is well known : stabilizing the prices of primary products , which are subject to sharp fluctuations , stabilizes their producers ’ incomes .
This argument inspired proposals – most famously by John Maynard Keynes in 1942 – to create “ buffer stocks ” for the main commodities , which would take supply off the market when prices fell , and add to supply when prices rose .
Keynes ’ s proposal never made it into the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 , and , while buffer ##AT##-##AT## stock schemes re ##AT##-##AT## surfaced in the 1970 ’ s , they , too , went nowhere .
Left ##AT##-##AT## wing economists like Raúl Prebisch , moreover , later advanced the theory of “ declining terms of trade ” for primary products : their prices ’ long ##AT##-##AT## run tendency to fall relative to the prices of manufactured goods .
This tendency seemed to be at work from the mid ##AT##-##AT## 1980 ’ s , as commodity producers experienced a persistent decline in prices .
In addition , price fluctuations throughout that decade were huge , with dire effects on sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan African and other developing countries that were largely dependent on commodities for export earnings .
Since then , however , the price decline has been reversed .
Food commodity prices have increased by 150 % since 2001 .
This has raised farm producers ’ income independently of the fair ##AT##-##AT## trade movement ’ s efforts .
The “ declining terms of trade ” argument has collapsed .
But primary ##AT##-##AT## product prices remain much more volatile than the prices of manufactured goods and services , causing large fluctuations in producers ’ incomes .
This exaggerates the effects of booms and busts .
So the issue of price stabilization has not gone away .
It is difficult to see how the fair ##AT##-##AT## trade movement can contribute much to solving this problem , because the only serious policy for stabilizing producers ’ incomes is to control supply .
But that is beyond the scope of fair trade .
The target of all versions of fair trade is “ free trade , ” and the most damaging attacks on FAIRTRADE have come from free traders .
In Unfair Trade , a pamphlet published in 2008 by the Adam Smith Institute , Mark Sidwell argues that FAIRTRADE keeps uncompetitive farmers on the land , holding back diversification and mechanization . According to Sidwell , the FAIRTRADE scheme turns developing countries into low ##AT##-##AT## profit , labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive agrarian ghettos , denying future generations the chance of a better life .
This is without considering the effect that FAIRTRADE has on the poorest people in these countries – not farmers but casual laborers – who are excluded from the scheme by its expensive regulations and labor standards .
In other words , FAIRTRADE protects farmers against their rivals and against agricultural laborers .
Consumers , Sidwell argues , are also being duped .
Only a tiny proportion – as little as 1 % – of the premium that we pay for a FAIRTRADE chocolate bar will ever make it to cocoa producers .
Nor is FAIRTRADE necessarily a guarantee of quality : because producers get a minimum price for fair ##AT##-##AT## trade goods , they sell the best of their crop on the open market .
But , despite its shaky economics , the fair ##AT##-##AT## trade movement should not be despised . While cynics say that its only achievement is to make consumers feel better about their purchases – rather like buying indulgences in the old Catholic Church – this is to sell fair trade short .
In fact , the movement represents a spark of protest against mindless consumerism , grass ##AT##-##AT## roots resistance against an impersonal logic , and an expression of communal activism .
That justification will not convince economists , who prefer a dryer sort of reasoning . But it is not out of place to remind ourselves that economists and bureaucrats need not always have things their own way .
CAMBRIDGE – Although some financial firms are reforming how they pay their employees , governments around the world are seriously considering regulating such firms ’ compensation structures .
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has recently come out in favor of such regulations , and the United States House of Representatives has voted to require regulators to set compensation rules .
Perhaps not surprisingly , many financial bosses are up in arms over such moves .
They claim that they need the freedom to set compensation packages in order to keep their most talented people – the ones who will revive the world ’ s financial system .
So , should governments step back and let financial firms reform themselves ?
The answer is clearly no .
In the post ##AT##-##AT## crisis financial order , governments must take on the role of monitoring and regulating pay in financial firms ; otherwise , the perverse incentives that contributed to the current crisis could easily recur .
It is important to distinguish between two sources of concern about pay in financial firms .
One set of concerns arises from the perspective of shareholders .
Figures recently released by New York ’ s attorney general , Andrew Cuomo , indicate that nine large financial firms paid their employees aggregate compensation exceeding $ 600 billion in 2003 ##AT##-##AT## 2008 – a period in which their aggregate market capitalization substantially declined .
Such patterns may raise concerns among shareholders that pay structures are not well designed to serve their interests .
Even if financial firms have governance problems that produce pay decisions deviating from shareholder interests , however , such problems do not necessarily warrant government regulation of those decisions .
Such problems are best addressed by rules that focus on improving internal governance processes and strengthening investors ’ rights , leaving the choices that determine compensation structures to corporate boards and the shareholders who elect them .
But pay in financial firms also raises a second important source of concern : even if compensation structures are designed in the interests of shareholders , they may produce incentives for excessive risk ##AT##-##AT## taking that are socially undesirable .
As a result , even if corporate governance problems in financial firms are fully addressed , a government role in regulating their compensation structures may still be warranted .
Suppose that most financial firms could be relied upon by regulators to be run in the interest of their shareholders .
Would this justify exempting these firms from existing regulations that constrain their decisions with respect to lending , investment , or capital reserves ?
Clearly not , because shareholders do not bear the full costs of a firm ’ s collapse , and , as the recent crisis demonstrates , the bill for such a downfall must be picked up , at least in part , by taxpayers and the economy .
So shareholders ’ interests might sometimes be served by business decisions that are too “ risky , ” and regulating such decisions is justified – indeed , necessary .
Regulation of pay in financial firms is called for by the same reasons that justify the traditional regulations of the firms ’ business decisions .
The incentives generated by compensation structures determine how firms ’ managers behave within the boundaries permitted by such traditional , direct regulations .
And as traditional regulation of business decisions is bound to be imperfect , regulating compensation structures can be a useful additional tool to control the risks posed by financial firms ’ behavior .
If choices of compensation structures can be expected to affect financial firms ’ stability , regulating these choices can also be useful for protecting this stability .
Financial firms opposed to pay regulation will likely warn against “ micro ##AT##-##AT## managing ” compensation , and argue that compensation choices must take into account information about each individual manager that regulators are almost certain to lack .
But pay regulation can improve matters without micro ##AT##-##AT## management by setting general standards from which firms may not deviate but that still leave them with significant freedom to account for the individual circumstances of managers .
For example , regulatory standards could require equity ##AT##-##AT## based plans to preclude managers from cashing out awarded shares and options during a certain minimum period after vesting .
In such a case , firms could still remain free to choose the number of shares and options awarded to any given manager , as well as to adjust somewhat the length of the post ##AT##-##AT## vesting period during which cashing out would be precluded .
Finally , those opposing pay regulation are certain to warn us about “ unintended consequences . ”
But this warning should not carry the day .
We have experienced over the last several years the real and costly consequences of a compensation regime that left financial firms free to set their own pay structures .
Are we to believe that those consequences are preferable to the unintended consequences of pay regulation ?
The effort to avoid the harm of flawed compensation decisions in the future should not be deterred by speculative arguments about unintended consequences .
Financial firms should not retain the freedom to create perverse incentives that put all of us at risk .
If public opinion polls are to be believed , on May 29 the French will reject the European Union ’ s draft constitutional treaty . Because all EU member countries must ratify the constitution , a French “ Non ” will , in effect , kill it .
Amazing as this turn of events seems , it has been long in the making .
It is amazing because France is not just a founding member of the European Community , but also has been the main driving force behind all major steps toward “ ever closer union . ”
But French opposition was also predictable because , for over a decade now , France has veered away from Europe and now finds itself increasingly isolated .
Of course , Europe has also moved away from France through successive enlargements , but the main roots of the estrangement lie in France itself .
The French regard with great sadness their declining status and prestige – not only in world politics , but also in culture , science and , importantly , language .
Europe , in their view , was always a way of reclaiming world influence .
For three decades , this worked .
France and Germany had forged an alliance that called the shots in Europe .
Not interested in geopolitical power – a legacy of its Nazi past – Germany was content to back France ’ s ambitions as long as the Common Market allowed it to be Europe ’ s economic powerhouse .
But that alliance is unraveling as Germany ’ s own status declines , owing to its mediocre economic performance and the loss of its prestigious Deutschemark .
Moreover , Germany is increasingly interested in exercising political influence on its own ; as a result , it is no longer happy with what it gets from the alliance with France .
At the same time , successive EU enlargements over the decades have brought in other powerful contenders , chiefly Spain and the UK , as well as smaller countries who are unwilling to bow before French ##AT##-##AT## German leadership .
In short , France has lost control of Europe .
This is not new , but it has only recently started to sink in , and it hurts .
France is also economically wounded .
Here is a country that has long cherished its “ exception ” from the normal rules of market economics , a foggy view that rejects both central planning and free markets and claims to offer a well ##AT##-##AT## balanced middle ground .
The French do not care that they have never been able to articulate their vision of a “ third way , ” for they remain deeply convinced that the state has a key role to play in steering markets in order to defend “ higher ” values from the single ##AT##-##AT## minded pursuit of materialism .
This view , propagated since World War II by a quasi ##AT##-##AT## Marxist intelligentsia , is so ingrained that the French do not even bother to understand how markets operate .
They look upon economics as an ideological battleground , where all views can be entertained without being confronted with logic , much less with facts .
Yet facts have been hitting hard .
Growth has been lackluster for a quarter of a century and unemployment remains stubbornly high .
Urban crime , once described as the wages of unfettered individualism , now resembles what is found in the United States , the French model ’ s bête noire .
What has this to do with Europe ?
The EU , by design , increases economic competition , but France is ill equipped .
One after the other , most European countries have reformed their economies , shedding the cozy arrangements that used to protect every interest group from the pressure of competition .
Even Germany , after even worse performance than France , has now taken decisive steps .
Unable to reform their labor markets because of the fear of street protests , French governments of all political stripes seek to protect their ailing firms , only to face limits imposed by the rules of the Common Market .
The bloated French public sector , which many see as the employer of last resort , cannot afford its expensive personnel .
While many private French firms are thriving , they do so by economizing on manpower and , increasingly , by outsourcing production , often to new EU member countries where labor costs are considerably lower .
Public education is in shambles and France ’ s higher education system now faces competition from other European countries .
Humbled by economic malaise and loss of influence , the French are scared .
They fear the future , because the future means either market ##AT##-##AT## oriented reforms or further economic and political downgrading , both of which are seen as unacceptable , if only because they clash with French self ##AT##-##AT## esteem .
The European Constitution has little to do with any of these challenges , but a majority of French people has started questioning the strategy that has long masked France ’ s diminishing status .
They are alarmed by what they see as the domination of Anglo ##AT##-##AT## Saxon economic principles – the last nail in the coffin of France ’ s mythical “ exception . ”
So the EU is now seen as the Trojan horse that threatens the myriad of state ##AT##-##AT## sanctioned benefits and handouts that every citizen enjoys .
Of course , most French people would ultimately benefit from doing away with this inefficient web of big and small privileges , but most voters , depressed by poor economic prospects and unnerved by high unemployment , are simply unwilling to take the risk .
They do not understand the roots of their economic troubles and are nostalgic for better times .
They mistakenly see the European Constitution as one more challenge , at a time when they want to be nursed and protected .
Scared people rarely make wise choices .
NEW YORK – Contrary to what skeptics often assert , the case for free trade is robust .
It extends not just to overall prosperity ( or “ aggregate GNP ” ) , but also to distributional outcomes , which makes the free ##AT##-##AT## trade argument morally compelling as well .
The link between trade openness and economic prosperity is strong and suggestive .
For example , Arvind Panagariya of Columbia University divided developing countries into two groups : “ miracle ” countries that had annual per capita GDP growth rates of 3 % or higher , and “ debacle ” countries that had negative or zero growth rates .
Panagariya found commensurate corresponding growth rates of trade for both groups in the period 1961 ##AT##-##AT## 1999 .
Of course , it could be argued that GDP growth causes trade growth , rather than vice versa – that is , until one examines the countries in depth .
Nor can one argue that trade growth has little to do with trade policy : while lower transport costs have increased trade volumes , so has steady reduction of trade barriers .
More compelling is the dramatic upturn in GDP growth rates in India and China after they turned strongly towards dismantling trade barriers in the late 1980 ’ s and early 1990 ’ s .
In both countries , the decision to reverse protectionist policies was not the only reform undertaken , but it was an important component .
In the developed countries , too , trade liberalization , which started earlier in the postwar period , was accompanied by other forms of economic opening ( for example , a return to currency convertibility ) , resulting in rapid GDP growth .
Economic expansion was interrupted in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s , but the cause was the macroeconomic crises triggered by the success of the OPEC cartel and the ensuing deflationary policies pursued by then ##AT##-##AT## Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker .
Moreover , the negative argument that historical experience supports the case for protectionism is flawed .
The economic historian Douglas Irwin has challenged the argument that nineteenth ##AT##-##AT## century protectionist policy aided the growth of infant industries in the United States .
He has also shown that many of the nineteenth century ’ s successful high ##AT##-##AT## tariff countries , such as Canada and Argentina , used tariffs as a revenue source , not as a means of sheltering domestic manufacturers .
Nor should free traders worry that trade openness resulted in no additional growth for some developing countries , as critics contend .
Trade is only a facilitating device .
For instance , if your infrastructure is bad , or you have domestic policies that prevent investors from responding to market opportunities ( such as South Asia ’ s stifling licensing restrictions ) , you will see no results .
To gain from trade openness , you have to ensure that complementary policies are in place .
But then critics shift ground and argue that trade ##AT##-##AT## driven growth benefits only the elites and not the poor ; it is not “ inclusive . ”
In India , however , the shift to accelerated growth after reforms that included trade liberalization has pulled nearly 200 million people out of poverty .
In China , which grew faster , it is estimated that more than 300 million people have moved above the poverty line since the start of reforms .
In fact , developed countries benefit from trade ’ s effect on poverty reduction as well .
Contrary to much popular opinion , trade with poor countries does not pauperize rich countries .
The opposite is true .
It is unskilled , labor ##AT##-##AT## saving technical change that is putting pressure on the wages of workers , whereas imports of cheaper , labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive goods from developing countries help the poor who consume these goods .
If freer trade reduces poverty , it is presumptuous for the critics to claim greater virtue .
In truth , the free traders control the moral high ground : with at least a billion people still living in poverty , what greater moral imperative do we have than to reduce that number ?
Talk about “ social justice ” is intoxicating , but actually doing something about it is difficult .
Here the free traders have a distinct edge .
As the historian Frank Trentmann has demonstrated , the case for free trade was made in nineteenth ##AT##-##AT## century Britain in moral terms : it was held to promote not just economic prosperity , but also peace .
It is also worth recalling that US Secretary of State Cordell Hull was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945 for policies that included his tireless efforts on behalf of multilateral free trade .
It is time for the Norwegian Nobel committee to step up again .
NEW YORK – Europe has been in a financial crisis since 2007 .
When the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers endangered the credit of financial institutions , private credit was replaced by the credit of the state , revealing an unrecognized flaw in the euro .
By transferring their right to print money to the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , member countries exposed themselves to the risk of default , like Third World countries heavily indebted in a foreign currency .
Commercial banks loaded with weaker countries ’ government bonds became potentially insolvent .
There is a parallel between the ongoing euro crisis and the international banking crisis of 1982 .
Back then , the International Monetary Fund saved the global banking system by lending just enough money to heavily indebted countries ; default was avoided , but at the cost of a lasting depression .
Latin America suffered a lost decade .
Germany is playing the same role today as the IMF did then .
The setting differs , but the effect is the same .
Creditors are shifting the entire burden of adjustment on to the debtor countries and avoiding their own responsibility .
The euro crisis is a complex mixture of banking and sovereign ##AT##-##AT## debt problems , as well as divergences in economic performance that have given rise to balance ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## payments imbalances within the eurozone .
The authorities did not understand the complexity of the crisis , let alone see a solution . So they tried to buy time .
Usually , that works .
Financial panics subside , and the authorities realize a profit on their intervention .
But not this time , because the financial problems were combined with a process of political disintegration .
When the European Union was created , it was the embodiment of an open society – a voluntary association of equal states that surrendered part of their sovereignty for the common good .
The euro crisis is now turning the EU into something fundamentally different , dividing member countries into two classes – creditors and debtors – with the creditors in charge .
As the strongest creditor country , Germany has emerged as the hegemon .
Debtor countries pay substantial risk premiums for financing their government debt .
This is reflected in their cost of financing in general .
To make matters worse , the Bundesbank remains committed to an outmoded monetary doctrine rooted in Germany ’ s traumatic experience with inflation .
As a result , it recognizes only inflation as a threat to stability , and ignores deflation , which is the real threat today .
Moreover , Germany ’ s insistence on austerity for debtor countries can easily become counterproductive by increasing the debt ratio as GDP falls .
There is a real danger that a two ##AT##-##AT## tier Europe will become permanent . Both human and financial resources will be attracted to the center , leaving the periphery permanently depressed .
But the periphery is seething with discontent .
Europe ’ s tragedy is not the result of an evil plot , but stems , rather , from a lack of coherent policies .
As in ancient Greek tragedies , misconceptions and a sheer lack of understanding have had unintended but fateful consequences .
Germany , as the largest creditor country , is in charge , but refuses to take on additional liabilities ; as a result , every opportunity to resolve the crisis has been missed .
The crisis spread from Greece to other deficit countries , eventually calling into question the euro ’ s very survival .
Since a breakup of the euro would cause immense damage , Germany always does the minimum necessary to hold it together .
Most recently , German Chancellor Angela Merkel has backed ECB President Mario Draghi , leaving Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann isolated .
This will enable the ECB to put a lid on the borrowing costs of countries that submit to an austerity program under the supervision of the Troika ( the IMF , the ECB , and the European Commission ) .
That will save the euro , but it is also a step toward the permanent division of Europe into debtors and creditors .
The debtors are bound to reject a two ##AT##-##AT## tier Europe sooner or later .
If the euro breaks up in disarray , the common market and the EU will be destroyed , leaving Europe worse off than it was when the effort to unite it began , owing to a legacy of mutual mistrust and hostility .
The later the breakup , the worse the ultimate outcome .
So it is time to consider alternatives that until recently would have been inconceivable .
In my judgment , the best course of action is to persuade Germany to choose between either leading the creation of a political union with genuine burden ##AT##-##AT## sharing , or leaving the euro .
Since all of the accumulated debt is denominated in euros , it makes all the difference who remains in charge of the monetary union.If Germany left , the euro would depreciate .
Debtor countries would regain their competitiveness ; their debt would diminish in real terms ; and , with the ECB under their control , the threat of default would disappear and their borrowing costs would fall to levels comparable to that in the United Kingdom .
The creditor countries , by contrast , would incur losses on their claims and investments denominated in euros and encounter stiffer competition at home from other eurozone members .
The extent of creditor countries ’ losses would depend on the extent of the depreciation , giving them an interest in keeping the depreciation within bounds .
After initial dislocations , the eventual outcome would fulfill John Maynard Keynes ’ dream of an international currency system in which both creditors and debtors share responsibility for maintaining stability .
And Europe would avert the looming depression .
The same result could be achieved , with less cost to Germany , if Germany chose to behave as a benevolent hegemon .
That would mean implementing the proposed European banking union ; establishing a more or less level playing field between debtor and creditor countries by establishing a Debt Reduction Fund , and eventually converting all debt into Eurobonds ; and aiming at nominal GDP growth of up to 5 % , so that Europe could grow its way out of excessive indebtedness .
Whether Germany decides to lead or leave , either alternative would be better than creating an unsustainable two ##AT##-##AT## tier Europe .
CAMBRIDGE – Greece will default on its national debt .
That default will be due in large part to its membership in the European Monetary Union .
If it were not part of the euro system , Greece might not have gotten into its current predicament and , even if it had gotten into its current predicament , it could have avoided the need to default .
Greece ’ s default on its national debt need not mean an explicit refusal to make principal and interest payments when they come due .
More likely would be an IMF ##AT##-##AT## organized restructuring of the existing debt , swapping new bonds with lower principal and interest for existing bonds .
Or it could be a “ soft default ” in which Greece unilaterally services its existing debt with new debt rather than paying in cash .
But , whatever form the default takes , the current owners of Greek debt will get less than the full amount that they are now owed .
The only way that Greece could avoid a default would be by cutting its future annual budget deficits to a level that foreign and domestic investors would be willing to finance on a voluntary basis .
At a minimum , that would mean reducing the deficit to a level that stops the rise in the debt ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## GDP ratio .
To achieve that , the current deficit of 14 % of GDP would have to fall to 5 % of GDP or less .
But to bring the debt ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## GDP ratio to the 60 % level prescribed by the Maastricht Treaty would require reducing the annual budget deficit to just 3 % of GDP – the goal that the eurozone ’ s finance ministers have said that Greece must achieve by 2012 .
Reducing the budget deficit by 10 % of GDP would mean an enormous cut in government spending or a dramatic rise in tax revenue – or , more likely , both .
Quite apart from the political difficulty of achieving this would be the very serious adverse effect on aggregate domestic demand , and therefore on production and employment .
Greece ’ s unemployment rate already is 10 % , and its GDP is already expected to fall at an annual rate of more than 4 % , pushing joblessness even higher .
Depressing economic activity further through higher taxes and reduced government spending would cause offsetting reductions in tax revenue and offsetting increases in transfer payments to the unemployed .
So every planned euro of deficit reduction delivers less than a euro of actual deficit reduction .
That means that planned tax increases and cuts in basic government spending would have to be even larger than 10 % of GDP in order to achieve a 3 % -of ##AT##-##AT## GDP budget deficit .
There simply is no way around the arithmetic implied by the scale of deficit reduction and the accompanying economic decline : Greece ’ s default on its debt is inevitable .
Greece might have been able to avoid that outcome if it were not in the eurozone .
If Greece still had its own currency , the authorities could devalue it while tightening fiscal policy .
A devalued currency would increase exports and would cause Greek households and firms to substitute domestic products for imported goods .
The increased demand for Greek goods and services would raise Greece ’ s GDP , increasing tax revenue and reducing transfer payments .
In short , fiscal consolidation would be both easier and less painful if Greece had its own monetary policy .
Greece ’ s membership in the eurozone was also a principal cause of its current large budget deficit .
Because Greece has not had its own currency for more than a decade , there has been no market signal to warn Greece that its debt was growing unacceptably large .
If Greece had remained outside the eurozone and retained the drachma , the large increased supply of Greek bonds would cause the drachma to decline and the interest rate on the bonds to rise .
But , because Greek euro bonds were regarded as a close substitute for other countries ’ euro bonds , the interest rate on Greek bonds did not rise as Greece increased its borrowing – until the market began to fear a possible default .
The substantial surge in the interest rate on Greek bonds relative to German bonds in the past few weeks shows that the market now regards such a default as increasingly likely .
The combination of credits from the other eurozone countries and lending by the IMF may provide enough liquidity to stave off default for a while .
In exchange for this liquidity support , Greece will be forced to accept painful fiscal tightening and falling GDP .
In the end , Greece , the eurozone ’ s other members , and Greece ’ s creditors will have to accept that the country is insolvent and cannot service its existing debt .
At that point , Greece will default .
CAMBRIDGE – The United States ’ import bill now exceeds $ 2.4 trillion a year , more than twice that of China and greater than that of the 27 European Union countries combined .
Since the volume of US imports varies with the overall strength of the American economy , so does the volume of other countries ’ exports .
So it was good news for everyone when the US economy began expanding in the summer of 2009 , 19 months after falling into the recession that officially started in December 2007 .
Unfortunately , the recovery has turned out to be very anemic .
Now , 15 months into the expansion , the level of real GDP is still lower than it was when the recession started .
Even more worrying , the rate of GDP growth has been declining almost from the start of the recovery .
Real GDP rose by 5 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 , reflecting the end of the decline in inventories .
GDP growth then fell to 3.7 % in the first quarter of 2010 and to only 1.7 % in the second quarter .
The third quarter is shaping up to be much like the second .
This recovery has been much weaker than previous ones because of fundamental differences in the cause of the downturn and in the policies chosen to achieve recovery .
Previous downturns were caused by the central bank ’ s efforts to reverse or prevent inflation by hiking short ##AT##-##AT## term interest rates .
When the central bank succeeded , it lowered those rates and the economy bounced back .
But this time the downturn was not caused by higher interest rates , and reducing those rates did not produce a strong rebound .
This recession was caused by a mispricing of risk , leading to excessive leverage and high prices for a wide range of assets .
When those price bubbles burst , households lost substantial wealth and financial markets became dysfunctional .
Because the downturn was not caused by high interest rates , lowering them could not lift the economy out of recession .
The Obama administration therefore turned to fiscal policy – tax cuts and a range of spending programs .
Unfortunately , the fiscal stimulus was not well enough designed to get the economy onto a strong , self ##AT##-##AT## sustaining growth path .
And , now that those stimulus programs are coming to an end , there is a danger that the economy will slide back into slow growth or even recession .
One key to the US economy ’ s future is household demand .
Although consumer spending has increased during the past four quarters , helped by substantial government transfer payments , the pace of spending growth by households was less than the overall pace of GDP growth , because households were increasing their rate of saving .
Indeed , household saving rose from 2 % of after ##AT##-##AT## tax incomes in 2007 to about 6 % in recent months .
If the saving rate continues to rise at the same pace in the future as it has over the past three years , the overall GDP growth rate could turn negative after a few quarters .
Of course , there is no way to be certain of what will happen to saving .
But it is worth remembering that the saving rate averaged 9 % in the quarter ##AT##-##AT## century from 1960 to 1985 .
If the saving rate now rises quickly to that level , it will be hard to keep overall GDP growing .
A significantly higher saving rate would help the US economy in the long run , but it would be a barrier to robust growth in the next few years .
A major obstacle to higher consumer spending is the current condition of the housing market .
The rapid rise in house prices until 2006 caused households to increase their spending , financed in part by converting home equity into cash .
But house prices have since fallen some 40 % on average , leaving one ##AT##-##AT## third of homeowners with mortgages owing more than their house is worth .
The resulting fall in wealth has reduced consumer spending , while the decline in homeowners ’ equity prevents borrowing to finance any increase .
And the recent end of a special tax subsidy for first ##AT##-##AT## time homebuyers has caused house prices to start falling again .
If that decline continues , it will inevitably reduce the pace of consumer spending .
Earlier this year , economic forecasters were predicting that annual GDP growth would reach 3 % or more in the second half of 2010 .
Now those projections have been cut to less than 2 % , which is too slow to make a dent in the very high rate of unemployment .
The forecasters have now shifted their predictions of 3 % -plus growth to 2011 .
Let ’ s hope that they are right this time .
Russia is living through the deepest , most prolonged crisis in modern history .
It is a man ##AT##-##AT## made crisis that has struck every sphere of society and the state .
This crisis is not a natural disaster but one engineered by the choice of a false doctrine of reform , one that is leading the country to degradation .
Few people believe in the Putin regime &apos;s ability to achieve serious change .
The corruption and inefficiency of the state apparatus and the government &apos;s incompetence and inertia leave no hope for a real improvement in living standards .
Instead of the state being strengthened , it is being reborn as a police ##AT##-##AT## bureaucratic apparatus to suppress social protest , extort bribes , and assure political repression .
I am running for president in order to cleanse the state apparatus of corruption and bureaucratic arbitrariness and to summon competent and responsible people into state service .
Russia cannot withstand another four years of plunder and destruction .
I am running so as to implement a real program to rebuild the economy .
The current regime will not implement such a program and will continue to serve the oligarchic clans that have grown fat by plundering state property .
Putin &apos;s corrupt and irresponsible regime has become part of the system of oligarchic parasitism , with its pathologically unjust distribution of incomes and property .
The current regime is ignoring an immutable law of governance : a state &apos;s effectiveness is indivisible from its responsibility for social justice .
By abandoning this responsibility , today &apos;s state has become not only ineffective but dangerous .
The impoverishment of great masses of the population has destroyed the structures of civil society , giving rise to a &quot; civilization of slums . &quot;
Roughly half of Russia &apos;s population , primarily children , is not getting enough to eat .
Child neglect and homelessness are growing .
Towns and villages are swamped by violence and banditry .
Poverty , psychological stress , and the collapse of health care have led to an anomalously high death rate , a mass decrease in health , and the wasting of colossal labor resources .
Many people cannot buy the most basic medicines and have no access to modern medical services .
The prospects for modernizing or even preserving the national health care system are shrinking with every year .
I am running in the election in order to guarantee everyone living in our country , which is the richest in the world , the constitutional right to a decent life and to develop freely .
In order to do this , we must take back as state revenue the profits from the exploitation of our natural wealth , double the budget , and guarantee everyone &apos;s real right to free education and healthcare .
The &quot; reforms &quot; that have been conducted over the last 15 years have denied a large proportion of the work ##AT##-##AT## fit population , primarily young people , of jobs and the right to a decent life .
But they are the backbone of our country .
Continuing on the current path will only destroy the nation &apos;s workers .
Implementing our program of social justice and economic growth will allow wages to be doubled in the course of a year by bringing them into line with labor &apos;s contribution to the national income , expanding workers &apos; rights to stand up for their interests , and increasing the minimum wage by three times .
Real wages should grow fourfold by 2010 ; pensions must also grow accordingly .
Economic growth must encompass all regions of the country , and people must have equal social guarantees , rights , and opportunities regardless of their place of residence .
At the moment , revenues are diverted away from the regions to the center and then dispatched abroad ­ - the oligarchs &apos; wealth of billions comes from fleecing the Russian provinces .
I will put an end to this .
To improve the economy we will direct lending to manufacturing and entrepreneurial activity , protect the right to honestly earned and legally acquired property , rebuild savings , and stimulate scientific ##AT##-##AT## technical innovation and investment .
Markets will be purged of criminals and monopolies ; honest competition will begin to operate .
Those who work well and benefit society will get high incomes , not those who take what belongs to other people .
The prices of basic commodities and charges for electricity , heating , and other vital services will be reduced to their actual production costs .
The geopolitical legacy of the USSR as a great power has been squandered over the years of &quot; reform . &quot;
Reform of the armed services has boiled down to disarmament alone .
Combat capability has fallen to an unprecedented low level .
Russia is being threatened with losing its status as a power .
Russia will not be reborn without the rebirth of a powerful , modern army .
Afflicted by corruption , the law ##AT##-##AT## enforcement authorities are not in a position to prevent the threat of terrorism or to crush organized crime .
I will purge these bodies of corruption , eradicate organized crime , and liberate our towns from terrorists and bandits .
Under the slogan of the market , the current regime has allowed depravity to flourish on television and in mass culture .
The profound values of Russian culture are being systematically destroyed , stripping life of its meaning and joy , and sowing an enmity of each against all .
To give Russians back a feeling of pride in their homeland , and to create the conditions for a revival of our historical spiritual and cultural traditions , we must revive our schools , eradicate the spirit of depravity and violence in the media , provide everyone with access to masterpieces of Russian culture , and create the conditions for a social partnership between the state and the church .
Now is the moment for Russians to take Russia back !
The Chinese leadership ’ s penchant for secretiveness is proverbial .
But the veil that exists over how that omnipotent party makes important decisions is being lifted somewhat because a volume of unique materials about the behind ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## scenes events surrounding the infamous Tiananmen massacre of 1989 is being published this month .
The materials contained in that book , which I brought out of China and decided to make public , consist of hundreds of documents , including minutes and transcripts of meetings at which the most important leaders of the People ’ s Republic deliberated on how to handle the Tienanmen demonstrations ; key speeches ; notes on crucial telephone conversations between leaders ; classified reports from security agencies ; and dispatches from the police and military .
Taken as a whole , these documents provide a rare glimpse into the modus operandi of China ’ s leaders .
As a witness and participant in the Tiananmen events , and as someone with access to the historical archive , I felt it my duty to publish this record of the decisions that lay behind what happened .
The real truth of what happened in l989 was locked in secret Party archives in Beijing for over a decade .
I chose to involve myself in this personally risky project because I believe those who wish to serve China must reflect deeply on the lessons of the Tiananmen events .
Despite undergoing great changes in the years since 1989 , China needs not only to reverse the verdict on the June 4th movement as &quot; a counter ##AT##-##AT## revolutionary rebellion , &quot; but also to restart its stalled process of political reform and democratization .
I believe that these documents will help serve those elusive ends .
Although the massacre in Tiananmen Square of June 4 , 1989 happened over ten years ago , it has not faded from people &apos;s memories .
Chinese history seems frozen at that date .
Far too many questions about those events remain unanswered .
The first step in achieving an accurate , complete , and objective re ##AT##-##AT## evaluation of what happened must involve , as Deng Xiaoping famously said , a &quot; search for truth in facts . &quot;
Only then can the true face of history be restored .
I believe that the following four lessons should guide those who are working for change in China and have motivated my actions in this case .
First , even though the Chinese Communist regime has become thoroughly corrupt , it has strengthened itself through economic growth and improvement in people &apos;s lives .
These achievements have enabled it to intensify its organizational penetration into almost every corner of society .
No political force in China can stand up to it .
People who do not like what the Party does must realize that they have nowhere else to turn ; they can rely only on themselves .
Even though the end of communism in China may seem a foregone conclusion , the fall of the Chinese Communist Party will be accomplished not by an outside force but only by its own members .
Second , given the lock that the Communist Party holds on all the levers of power , the building of democracy in China depends on forces rooted inside China .
Those who have worked overseas for democracy , freedom , and the rule of law and who have sought the support of the international community have done necessary work .
But real solutions to China &apos;s problems must be sought at home .
Third , change from inside is possible because the Chinese Communist Party today resembles the Communist Party of the Soviet Union around 1989 .
What looks on the outside like a solid structure can break into pieces overnight .
The Chinese Communist Party has long since ceased to be a traditional Communist party .
It is now a mélange of factions with diverse goals and differing ideologies .
The differences between radicals and conservatives in the Party are now sharper than those between the Party and its historic rival , the Kuomintang .
The key force pushing for political change is the pro ##AT##-##AT## democracy faction within the Party .
So what will replace the Chinese Communist Party will probably be a new force that emerges from inside the party ; a group that regrets the errors of the Communist system , a group committed to establishing a healthy democracy .
This group will unite with forces of democratization both at home and abroad to establish a truly democratic system .
Fourth , reversal of the verdict on June 4th is an historical inevitability , as well as the wish of most of China ’ s people .
June 4th weighs on the spirits of every Chinese patriot ; almost every Chinese person knows that official reevaluation is just a matter of time .
Indeed , the Party &apos;s top leadership has been divided about the event ever since it occurred .
Today , many of those responsible for the decision to crack down - notably Deng Xiaoping and others of the Party Elders – have died .
So calls to reverse the verdict are growing , both inside and outside the Party .
These calls will eventually form the mainstream , and the liberal forces within the Party will undoubtedly respond by seizing a historic opportunity not only to reverse the verdict but to move toward discarding the Communist system .
Chinese democracy still has a long , hard road before it .
Among other things , it needs a class of well ##AT##-##AT## educated activists it lost when many young people left China to study and build a better life elsewhere .
Even if risk and a large degree of self ##AT##-##AT## sacrifice are required , these young people should return to join those in China , including those within the Communist Party , that are working for change .
As Lu Xun said , &quot; A true warrior dares to stare the sadness of life in the face and to see the blood that drips there . &quot;
NEW HAVEN – Today , fears are growing that China and India are about to be the next victims of the ongoing global economic carnage .
This would have enormous consequences .
Asia ’ s developing and newly industrialized economies grew at an 8.5 % average annual rate over 2010 ##AT##-##AT## 11 – nearly triple the 3 % growth elsewhere in the world .
If China and India are next to fall , Asia would be at risk , and it would be hard to avoid a global recession .
In one important sense , these concerns are understandable : both economies depend heavily on the broader global climate .
China is sensitive to downside risks to external demand – more relevant than ever since crisis ##AT##-##AT## torn Europe and the United States collectively accounted for 38 % of total exports in 2010 .
But India , with its large current ##AT##-##AT## account deficit and external funding needs , is more exposed to tough conditions in global financial markets .
Yet fears of hard landings for both economies are overblown , especially regarding China .
Yes , China is paying a price for aggressive economic stimulus undertaken in the depths of the subprime crisis .
The banking system funded the bulk of the additional spending , and thus is exposed to any deterioration in credit quality that may have arisen from such efforts .
There are also concerns about frothy property markets and mounting inflation .
While none of these problems should be minimized , they are unlikely to trigger a hard landing . Long fixated on stability , Chinese policymakers have been quick to take preemptive action .
That is particularly evident in Chinese officials ’ successful campaign against inflation .
Administrative measures in the agricultural sector , aimed at alleviating supply bottlenecks for pork , cooking oil , fresh vegetables , and fertilizer , have pushed food ##AT##-##AT## price inflation lower .
This is the main reason why the headline consumer inflation rate receded from 6.5 % in July 2011 to 4.2 % in November .
Meanwhile , the People ’ s Bank of China , which hiked benchmark one ##AT##-##AT## year lending rates five times in the 12 months ending this October , to 6.5 % , now has plenty of scope for monetary easing should economic conditions deteriorate .
The same is true with mandatory reserves in the banking sector , where the government has already pruned 50 basis points off the record 21.5 % required ##AT##-##AT## reserve ratio .
Relatively small fiscal deficits – only around 2 % of GDP in 2010 – leave China with an added dimension of policy flexibility should circumstances dictate .
Nor has China been passive with respect to mounting speculative excesses in residential property .
In April 2010 , it implemented tough new regulations , raising down ##AT##-##AT## payments from 20 % to 30 % for a first home , to 50 % for a second residence , and to 100 % for purchases of three or more units .
This strategy appears to be working .
In November , house prices declined in 49 of the 70 cities that China monitors monthly .
Moreover , it is a serious exaggeration to claim , as many do today , that the Chinese economy is one massive real ##AT##-##AT## estate bubble .
Yes , total fixed investment is approaching an unprecedented 50 % of GDP , but residential and nonresidential real estate , combined , accounts for only 15 ##AT##-##AT## 20 % of that – no more than 10 % of the overall economy .
In terms of floor space , residential construction accounts for half of China ’ s real ##AT##-##AT## estate investment .
Identifying the share of residential real estate that goes to private developers in the dozen or so first ##AT##-##AT## tier cities ( which account for most of the Chinese property market ’ s fizz ) suggests that less than 1 % of GDP would be at risk in the event of a housing ##AT##-##AT## market collapse – not exactly a recipe for a hard landing .
As for Chinese banks , the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local ##AT##-##AT## government debt , which , according to the government , totaled $ 1.7 trillion ( roughly 30 % of GDP ) at the end of 2010 .
Approximately half of this debt was on their books prior to the crisis .
Some of the new debt that resulted from the stimulus could well end up being impaired , but ongoing urbanization – around 15 ##AT##-##AT## 20 million people per year move to cities – provides enormous support on the demand side for investment in infrastructure development and residential and commercial construction .
That tempers the risks to credit quality and , along with relatively low loan ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## deposit ratios of around 65 % , should cushion the Chinese banking system .
India is more problematic .
As the only economy in Asia with a current ##AT##-##AT## account deficit , its external funding problems can hardly be taken lightly .
Like China , India ’ s economic ##AT##-##AT## growth momentum is ebbing .
But unlike China , the downshift is more pronounced – GDP growth fell through the 7 % threshold in the third calendar ##AT##-##AT## year quarter of 2011 , and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1 % in October .
But the real problem is that , in contrast to China , Indian authorities have far less policy leeway .
For starters , the rupee is in near free ##AT##-##AT## fall .
That means that the Reserve Bank of India – which has hiked its benchmark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still ##AT##-##AT## serious inflation problem – can ill afford to ease monetary policy .
Moreover , an outsize consolidated government budget deficit of around 9 % of GDP limits India ’ s fiscal ##AT##-##AT## policy discretion .
While China is in better shape than India , neither economy is likely to implode on its own .
It would take another shock to trigger a hard landing in Asia . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
One obvious possibility today would be a disruptive breakup of the European Monetary Union .
In that case , both China and India , like most of the world ’ s economies , could find themselves in serious difficulty – with an outright contraction of Chinese exports , as in late 2008 and early 2009 , and heightened external funding pressures for India .
While I remain a euro ##AT##-##AT## skeptic , I believe that the political will to advance European integration will prevail .
Consequently , I attach a low probability to the currency union ’ s disintegration .
Barring such a worst ##AT##-##AT## case outcome for Europe , the odds of a hard landing in either India or China should remain low .
Seduced by the political economy of false prosperity , the West has squandered its might .
Driven by strategy and stability , Asia has built on its newfound strength .
But now it must reinvent itself .
Japanese ##AT##-##AT## like stagnation in the developed world is challenging externally dependent Asia to shift its focus to internal demand .
Downside pressures currently squeezing China and India underscore that challenge .
Asia ’ s defining moment could be hand .
CAMBRIDGE – America ’ s enormous budget deficit is now exceeded as a share of national income only by Greece and Egypt among all of the world ’ s major countries .
To be sure , the current deficit of 9.1 % of GDP is due in part to the automatic effects of the recession .
But , according to the official projections of the United States Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , even after the economy returns to full employment , the deficit will remain so large that America ’ s national debt ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## GDP ratio will continue to rise for the rest of this decade and beyond .
Understanding how to achieve US fiscal consolidation requires understanding why the budget deficit is projected to remain so high .
Before looking at the projected future deficits , consider what happened in the first two years of President Barack Obama ’ s administration that caused the deficit to rise from 3.2 % of GDP in 2008 to 8.9 % of GDP in 2010 ( which in turn pushed up the national debt ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## GDP ratio from 40 % to 62 % ) .
The 5.7 % -of ##AT##-##AT## GDP rise in the budget deficit reflected a 2.6 % -of ##AT##-##AT## GDP fall in tax revenues ( from 17.5 % to 14.9 % of GDP ) and 3.1 % -of ##AT##-##AT## GDP rise in outlays ( from 20.7 % to 23.8 % of GDP ) .
According to the CBO , less than half of the 5.7 % -of ##AT##-##AT## GDP increase in the budget deficit was the result of the economic downturn , as the automatic stabilizers added 2.5 % of GDP to the rise in the deficit between 2008 and 2010 .
The CBO analysis calls the changes in the budget deficit induced by cyclical conditions “ automatic stabilizers , ” on the theory that the revenue decline and expenditure increase ( mainly for unemployment benefits and other transfer payments ) caused by an economic downturn contribute to aggregate demand and thus help to stabilize the economy .
In other words , even without the automatic stabilizers – that is , if the economy had been at full employment in 2008 ##AT##-##AT## 2010 – the US budget deficit still would have increased by 3.2 % of GDP .
Lower revenue and increased outlays each account for about half of this “ full ##AT##-##AT## employment ” rise in the deficit .
Looking ahead , the CBO projects that enacting the budget proposed by the Obama administration in February would add $ 3.8 trillion to the national debt between 2010 and 2020 , causing the debt ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## GDP ratio to soar from 62 % to 90 % .
That $ 3.8 trillion net debt increase reflects a roughly $ 5 trillion increase in the deficit , owing to higher spending and weaker revenues from middle- and lower ##AT##-##AT## income taxpayers , offset in part by $ 1.3 trillion in tax increases , primarily on high ##AT##-##AT## income earners .
Even this enormous increase in the projected deficits and debt underestimates the fiscal damage that the Obama administration ’ s budget , if enacted , would inflict .
The proposed budget assumes that non ##AT##-##AT## defense “ discretionary ” spending ( which requires congressional approval , unlike so ##AT##-##AT## called “ mandatory ” spending like Social Security pension benefits , which continues to grow unless Congress changes the benefits ) will rise by a total of only 5 % in the decade 2010 ##AT##-##AT## 2020 , implying a decline in real terms and no scope for new programs .
The annual level of defense spending is projected to decline by about $ 50 billion in each year after 2012 – a very optimistic view of US military needs in the decade ahead .
Shrinking America ’ s budget deficit to prevent a further rise in the debt ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## GDP ratio from its current level will require reduced spending and increased revenue .
That increase in revenue can be achieved without raising marginal tax rates , namely by limiting the amount of tax reduction that individuals and businesses can achieve from the various “ tax expenditures ” that form an important part of the US tax code .
But that is a subject for another column .
On the expenditure side , however , the prospect that the national debt could double during the next decade is just the start of the fiscal problem that the US now faces .
The budget outlook in subsequent decades is dominated by the increasing costs of Social Security and Medicare benefits , which are projected to take the debt ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## GDP ratio from 90 % in 2020 to 190 % in 2035 .
Fundamental reform of these programs is the primary challenge for America ’ s public finances – and thus for the long ##AT##-##AT## term health of the US economy .
Providence , R.I. – China is now celebrating the 30th anniversary of the period officially known as “ reform and opening . ”
Labeling time in this way echoes China ’ s imperial history .
During moments of political transition – a military victory , for example – the emperor might designate a special “ era name ” to help celebrate the good news .
Or the court might test out a new era name after a political debacle , in an effort to wipe the slate clean .
The last emperor of the Tang Dynasty proclaimed seven era names in fourteen years , as he sought in vain to “ re ##AT##-##AT## brand ” his reign and avoid his regime ’ s demise .
Deng Xiaoping began to champion “ reform and opening ” in 1978 . “ Reform ” suggested a loosening of central controls on economic life , undertaken in a spirit of pragmatism and gradualism , as an antidote to Mao Zedong ’ s ideology of “ revolution . ”
Similarly , “ opening ” heralded the PRC ’ s integration into the world community – especially the capitalist West .
Deng ’ s principles still guide policy today .
One must go back to the Qing Dynasty ( 1644 ##AT##-##AT## 1912 ) and its 60 ##AT##-##AT## year era of “ heavenly flourishing ” ( Qianlong ) in the eighteenth century to find a comparable period of coherent political and economic policy .
The era of “ reform and opening ” has outlived its “ emperor ” by more than a decade , and has been the common thread running through transfers of political authority from Deng to Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao .
Even the largest popular challenge the Chinese Communist Party ever faced , the demonstrations of 1989 , now looks like a blip that helped Deng consolidate support for his model of development .
If one factor undergirds China ’ s commitment to “ reform and opening , ” it is the extraordinary macroeconomic changes of the past 30 years .
In China , people call it fazhan , or “ development , ” but in much of rest of the world , it is more commonly described simply as the “ China Boom , ” or the “ China Miracle . ”
The boom began in the countryside in the late 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s , and was followed by today ’ s urban , industrial ##AT##-##AT## led growth .
Indeed , there have been many smaller “ booms ” – in consumption , foreign direct investment , domestic stock markets , trade , travel , overseas study , military modernization , and international diplomacy .
There is also a boom in pollution and toxic waste , and booming interest in religion – from Buddhism to Pentecostal Christianity – and in Confucian philosophy .
Little in China today speaks of moderation .
A leading fashion industry executive argues that a key engine driving the economic boom has been the influx of women into the workforce , particularly in the manufacturing zones of the south .
Another compelling explanation comes from a venture capitalist who credits Chinese society with copious reserves of entrepreneurial energy that derives , he believes , from the fact that Chinese culture attaches very little shame to failing in a business enterprise .
High tolerance for failure keeps everybody striving to succeed .
Whatever the cause , the boom seems an unlikely capstone to a century of war , ferment , and revolution , and only adds to the sense of discontinuity that characterizes modern China .
Certainly , few observers looking in 1978 at the smoldering embers of the Cultural Revolution , or at the seeming ruination of the post ##AT##-##AT## 1989 years , thought China would emerge as the lightning rod of the world ’ s developmental hopes .
Paradoxically , the apparently discontinuous and contradictory nature of the “ era of reform and opening ” may actually help explain how China ’ s boom came about .
The tumult of the Maoist period instilled in a broad cross ##AT##-##AT## section of people a profound appreciation for stability , and a yearning to be left alone .
Deng capitalized on this revolution ##AT##-##AT## weariness by diminishing the role of politics and the state in people ’ s private lives and freeing them to release their pent ##AT##-##AT## up energy to pursue their own goals .
Revolutionary communism may well have cleared the path for the boom in other ways as well , suggesting that the shift from socialist utopianism to capitalist pragmatism was less a U ##AT##-##AT## turn than a sequential process of “ creative destruction . ”
After all , Mao ’ s Cultural Revolution against “ feudal society ” did raze much of the cultural landscape , denuding it not only of traditional values and institutions , but also of failed socialist efforts , leaving China ready for the seeds of capitalist development .
Mao ’ s revolution fueled countless rectification movements and campaigns that inverted the once ##AT##-##AT## inviolate primacy of ruler over ruled , scholar over worker , husband over wife , father over son , and family over individual .
By the time of the reforms of the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , bonds tying individuals to culture , the state , the work unit , and household ##AT##-##AT## registration systems , for example , had largely unraveled .
The path had been cleared for a vast new population of atomized entrepreneurs and laborers , freed from fealty to family and Party , to storm the marketplace with newly liberated individual energy .
Of course , the boom ’ s costs should not be discounted .
Environmental damage has been staggering , the gap between rich and poor has been growing , and urbanization – with all its attendant problems – has surged .
And , at least so far , the boom has not induced the systemic political changes for which many hoped .
But still , a key question remains unanswered : why did China ’ s boom happen ?
This is one of the great questions of our time , relevant not only to China ’ s future , but to scores of other developing countries enthralled by China ’ s extraordinary , but still largely unexplained , success .
The urban disturbances in France have been called the most severe since the riots by students and workers in 1968 .
The analogy is misleading .
While the 1968 protests challenged the French Republican model to live up to its finest aspirations , today ’ s crisis challenges the French Revolution ’ s model of citizenship and integration itself .
The French Republican model asserts that all French citizens have the same cultural identity . Indeed , this is the only acceptable identity .
To achieve this shared identity , all citizens have to speak the one official language and be educated according to a common curriculum .
But they also enjoy equal rights , and have the same duties , in the public arena .
All this is not only fostered by the state , but also requires the kind of uniformity that only a centralized state can impose .
Indeed , the French Revolution ’ s ideological commitment to unity was so strong that during parts of the nineteenth century , advocating federalism was a capital offense .
Three components of this model incited today ’ s crisis and make it difficult for the French Republic to address it effectively .
The first component is the classic French Republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census – or by government agencies or public or private enterprises – on ethnicity , religion , and even social class .
Collecting these data would , it is argued , violate the Republican tenet that France is “ one and indivisible . ”
But the absence of a secondary breakdown of such data , like the UK ##AT##-##AT## style , four ##AT##-##AT## fold class analysis ( plus examination of patterns of unemployment by ethnicity or religion ) , makes it hard for social workers , public heath officials , and economic planners to diagnose new problems .
Without the necessary data for analysis , public health policies , for example , cannot be directed toward groups that are especially disadvantaged or otherwise at risk .
The second factor is the classic French Republican rejection of , and legal norms against , any form of “ affirmative action , ” or positive discrimination , even of the most inoffensive kind .
Like the prohibition of fine ##AT##-##AT## tuned data – without which positive discrimination is in any case impossible – affirmative action is seen as damaging to the Republican model because it is based on recognition of ethnic differences .
The third component is the post ##AT##-##AT## welfare state , which is now part of the French model of citizenship and guarantees all full ##AT##-##AT## time employees one of the highest minimum wages in the world and high employer ##AT##-##AT## paid benefits .
This makes it extremely difficult to let workers go , which makes employers reluctant to hire new people in the first place .
Many of the social ##AT##-##AT## democratic countries of Europe , like Sweden , Holland , and Denmark , created similar norms in their full ##AT##-##AT## employment eras .
Unlike France , however , they also used census data to identify pockets of new unemployment , and to invest socially and politically , not only in excellent job ##AT##-##AT## training programs , but in job creation , and , just as importantly , in job ##AT##-##AT## placement schemes .
France is now very bad at creating new jobs .
It has few training programs , but high benefits for the unemployed and strong restrictions against firing workers .
Put all of this together , and it is like slamming a door in the face of young minority men looking for work .
This is the primary cause of the 30 ##AT##-##AT## 50 % unemployment rates among minorities aged 16 ##AT##-##AT## 24 in many French “ urban zones of sensitivity . ”
Thus , the riots that France is now seeing emerge from French policies , not from instigations by Islamists .
France has simply failed to incorporate minority citizens – many of them third ##AT##-##AT## generation immigrants who have been educated for twenty years in assimilationist public schools .
But few political leaders accept that the crisis has anything to do with the French model of citizenship .
Indeed , they confidently wait for assimilation to kick in .
But in today ’ s high unemployment , low job ##AT##-##AT## creation , and now multicultural France , assimilation will not occur without big changes .
France is only now beginning to come to grips with the crisis of its Republican model of equal citizenship .
A newly created Minister of Social Cohesion has begun to commission studies documenting discrimination .
One study showed that for similarly qualified job applicants , those with an Islamic ##AT##-##AT## sounding name , and an address in an ethnically segmented suburb , had only one ##AT##-##AT## fifth the chance of even getting an interview as people with a French ##AT##-##AT## sounding name and a “ safe ” address .
Two hundred and fifty of the largest private and public enterprises have created an organization aimed at working with the government to allow them , for the first time ever , to document , and then redress , their discriminatory employment practices .
Fortunately , organized Muslim leaders so far have not aggravated the rioting .
Of course , the government ’ s reduction of community policing in favor of paramilitary forces stationed in quasi ##AT##-##AT## military barracks , and the Minister of Interior ’ s description of the young rioters as “ scum ” who should be washed away with an industrial power hose , has not helped .
The French Republican model enshrines the laudable abstract principles of liberty , equality , and fraternity .
However , so long as second- and third ##AT##-##AT## generation minority citizens are taught that the only acceptable cultural identity is French , but are not in fact accepted as French – indeed , are blocked from enjoying the full rights of French citizenship – the Republican model will fuel alienation rather than democratic integration .
NEW YORK – As Swedish prosecutors ’ sex ##AT##-##AT## crime allegations against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange play out in the international media , one convention of the coverage merits serious scrutiny .
We know Assange by name .
But his accusers – the two Swedish women who have brought the complaints against him – are consistently identified only as “ Miss A ” and “ Miss W , ” and their images are blurred .
News organizations argue that the policy is motivated by respect for the alleged victims .
But the same organizations would never report charges of , say , fraud – or , indeed , non ##AT##-##AT## sexual assault – against a suspect who has been named on the basis on anonymous accusations .
In fact , despite its good intentions , providing anonymity in sex ##AT##-##AT## crime cases is extremely harmful to women .
The convention of not naming rape accusers is a relic of the Victorian period , when rape and other sex crimes were being codified and reported in ways that prefigure our own era .
Rape was seen as “ the fate worse than death , ” rendering women – who were supposed to be virgins until marriage – “ damaged goods . ”
Virginia Woolf called the ideal of womanhood in this period “ The Angel in the House ” : a retiring , fragile creature who could not withstand the rigors of the public arena .
Of course , this ideal was a double ##AT##-##AT## edged sword : their ostensible fragility – and their assigned role as icons of sexual purity and ignorance – was used to exclude women from influencing outcomes that affected their own destinies .
For example , women could not fully participate under their own names in legal proceedings .
Indeed , one of the rights for which suffragists fought was the right to be convicted of one ’ s own crimes .
Nonetheless , even after women gained legal rights – and even as other assumptions about women have gone the way of smelling salts and whalebone stays – the condescending Victorian convention of not identifying women who make sex ##AT##-##AT## crime charges remains with us .
That convention not only is an insult to women , but also makes rape prosecutions far more difficult .
Overwhelmingly , anonymity serves institutions that do not want to prosecute rapists or sexual harassers .
The United States military , for instance , hides rape accusers ’ identities , and the prevalence of rape in the US armed forces today is off the charts .
Maintaining anonymous charges enables the military authorities to avoid keeping comprehensive records , which in turn allows officials to evade responsibility for transparent reporting of assaults and of prosecutions – and thus not to prosecute sex crime in any serious , systematic way .
The same is true with universities .
My alma mater , Yale , used anonymity in reporting of sex harassment and rape to sweep sex ##AT##-##AT## crime incidents and repeat offenders ’ records under the rug for two decades , thereby protecting its own interest in preventing systematic investigation .
Because of the prevalence of universities ’ anonymity policy , at least two alleged serial rapists – whose assaults were reported to their employers separately by more than one victim – are teaching at new universities , with no charges ever brought against them .
The lesson is clear : when charges are made anonymously , no one takes them as seriously as charges brought in public , resulting in institutionalized impunity for sexual predators .
Indeed , only when victims have stood up and stated their names – granted , a difficult and often painful thing to do – have institutional change and successful prosecutions been possible .
Anita Hill ’ s decision in 1991 not to make anonymous accusations against Clarence Thomas , now a US Supreme Court justice , spurred a wave of enforcement of equal ##AT##-##AT## employment ##AT##-##AT## opportunity law .
Hill knew that her motives would be questioned .
But , as a lawyer , she understood how unethical anonymous allegations are – and how unlikely they are to bring about real consequences .
In fact , the convention of anonymity merely allows rape myths to flourish .
When victims are not kept hidden , it becomes much clearer that rape can happen to anyone – grandmothers and students , homemakers and prostitutes .
Instead , we have stereotypes about how “ real ” rape victims must look and act in order to be taken seriously .
And we have the myth of higher false reporting of rape relative to other crimes ( in the US , the rate is no different : 2 ##AT##-##AT## 4 % ) .
Feminists have long argued that rape must be treated like any other crime .
But in no other crime are accusers kept behind a wall of anonymity . Treating rape so differently serves only to maintain its mischaracterization as a “ different ” kind of crime , loaded with cultural baggage and projections .
Finally , there is a profound moral issue at stake .
Though children ’ s identities should , of course , be shielded in sex ##AT##-##AT## crime allegations , women are not children .
If one makes a serious criminal accusation , one must wish to be treated – and one must treat oneself – as a moral adult .
That is why justice systems – at least in democracies – typically demand that the accused be able to face his or her accuser .
Why , for example , in a case that is so dependent on public opinion – and on which so much depends – must Assange face allegations that may have grave consequences for him , while his accusers remain hidden ?
So ##AT##-##AT## called “ rape shield ” laws should be used to protect alleged victims . It is no one ’ s business whom a victim has slept with previously , or what she was wearing when she was attacked .
But preventing an accuser ’ s sexual history from entering into an investigation or prosecution is not the same as providing anonymity .
Nor should it be .
After all , motive and context are legitimate questions in any serious criminal allegation .
Hill , for example , knew that she would have to explain why she waited years to accuse Thomas , her former employer .
Likewise , adult accusers of Church ##AT##-##AT## protected sex criminals knew that they would have to answer fundamental questions ( notably , many of them have identified themselves , which has helped get real prosecutions ) .
It is wrong – and sexist – to treat female sex ##AT##-##AT## crime accusers as if they were children , and it is wrong to try anyone , male or female , in the court of public opinion on the basis of anonymous accusations .
Anonymity for rape accusers is long overdue for retirement .
Mexico City – As I reflect on my troubled country , the lyrics of a Bruce Springsteen song come to mind : “ We are far , far away from home .
Our home is far , far away from us . ”
That ’ s how it feels to live in Mexico nowadays : far from democratic normalcy ; far from a health system that inspires confidence ; far from a government that builds trust ; far from home and close to everything that imperils it .
My homeland has become a place where too many people are victims , succumbing to a virus , or gunned down by a drug ##AT##-##AT## trafficker ; assaulted by a robber , shot by an ill ##AT##-##AT## trained policeman , or kidnapped by a member of a criminal gang .
The flu epidemic , which probably began in the southern state of Veracruz , is yet another sign that all is not well in Mexico .
The country seems to be caught in a permanent , uneasy tug ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## war between the past and the future , between change and the actors who seek to place obstacles in its path .
For example , when initial reports surfaced about the first swine flu cases , it took three weeks for the information to reach federal health authorities , because state governments were reluctant to report cases quickly due to political and electoral considerations .
Mexico faces mid ##AT##-##AT## term elections for Congress in the fall , and President Felipe Calderón ’ s National Action Party is trailing slightly in the polls over its main rivals , who would like nothing better than to see a health emergency translate into a political defeat .
In the face of a public health system that seemed incapable of diagnosing and treating the outbreak quickly , the government felt it had little choice but to shut down Mexico City , dealing a severe blow to an already crippled economy .
In contrast with Mexico ’ s authoritarian past , when an “ imperial presidency ” constituted a major obstacle to modernization , power has been dispersed .
What the executive branch has relinquished , or been forced to give up , vested interests have seized .
The problem is no longer too much power in the president ’ s hands , but too much power in the hands of “ veto centers ” – including public ##AT##-##AT## sector unions – that are blocking much ##AT##-##AT## needed reforms , including in the health system .
In all likelihood , the 22 reported dead from swine flu reflect a social safety net falling to pieces due to lack of public investment and union recalcitrance .
The flu also revealed some of Mexico ’ s other fundamental flaws .
The political system has become a peculiar hybrid of authoritarian remnants and newly established mechanisms for transparency .
The electoral process has been unable to guarantee decent democratic governance , rein in predatory practices among the political class , or make public officials follow established rules , keep them responsive to citizen preferences , and deter them from channeling public funds into private hands .
Lack of accountability has both encouraged corruption and fed perceptions that abuse remains unpunished .
Impunity , in turn , erodes the credibility of the country ’ s institutions , including public hospitals and clinics .
Today , conspiracy theories abound in Mexico about the origins of the virus , because government officials are viewed with such ingrained suspicion .
Throughout the epidemic , citizens have largely obeyed government guidelines and followed public health prescriptions .
But that doesn ’ t mean they trust the government .
Public ##AT##-##AT## opinion polls reveal that more than 50 % of the population believe that political parties are “ not necessary ” for the good of the country .
Disapproval of Congress is growing , and people ’ s satisfaction with representative democracy has decreased .
In the midst of the epidemic , 66 % of Mexicans believe that the country is regressing .
Seventy ##AT##-##AT## five percent of crimes are not reported due to lack of trust in the authorities , and 98 % of crimes are never resolved or punished .
Public opinion seems disenchanted with a democracy incapable of offering tangible solutions to problems , the flu crisis being the most recent example .
Saddled by a viral infection , drug ##AT##-##AT## related insecurity , and rising crime , Mexico feels like a besieged place .
The noted columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa wrote last week : “ All that ’ s missing is for Mexico to get peed on by a dog . ”
Mexico ’ s bad health is a symptom of problems that run deeper and are more widespread than swine flu .
Over the past ten years , political and economic actors intent on preserving the status quo have blocked further democratic change and economic reform , condemning Mexico to move sideways , even as other emerging markets surge ahead .
Lately , political battles among key actors have not been about how to build a more effective of representative political system or a more equitable , dynamic economy , but about how to maintain control of accumulated power or distribute it among their allies .
Political parties appear far removed from citizen demands , beset by internal divisions , incapable of addressing deep ##AT##-##AT## rooted inequality and lawlessness , and prone to populist or authoritarian leadership that promises quick fixes to entrenched problems .
Mexico ’ s current quandary is the flu , but it faces more important challenges than a mutating microbe .
With more than 40 million people living in poverty and 7,000 killed in drug ##AT##-##AT## related violence last year , Mexico will need to reform quickly to address what the virus has brought to light : a government far removed from the suffering of ordinary people and too frequently insensitive to their plight .
In this national crisis , Mexico ’ s people have closed ranks , collaborated , and showed that they are capable of working together to achieve common goals in the public interest .
But their political and economic elites frequently seem incapable of doing so .
That is why home seems far , far away for so many Mexicans .
OXFORD – In almost every rich country , anti ##AT##-##AT## immigrant fervor is at fever pitch .
But it is a malady that must be resisted if these societies are to continue to prosper and developing countries are to fight poverty and sustain economic growth .
A higher rate of global migration is desirable for four reasons : it is a source of innovation and dynamism ; it responds to labor shortages ; it meets the challenges posed by rapidly aging populations ; and it provides an escape from poverty and persecution .
By contrast , limiting migration slows economic growth and undermines societies ’ long ##AT##-##AT## term competitiveness .
It also creates a less prosperous , more unequal , and partitioned world .
Of course , there are short ##AT##-##AT## run , local costs to higher rates of migration that must be addressed if societies are to enjoy the much larger long ##AT##-##AT## term benefits .
And yet , despite domestic opposition in recipient countries , the number of international migrants has doubled over the past 25 years , and will double again by 2030 .
Rapid economic and political change – and , increasingly , environmental change – dislodges people and encourages them to seek opportunity and security in new homes .
Against the backdrop of rapid globalization , the individual risks and costs of moving internationally will continue to fall .
The combination of the estimated increase in the world ’ s population by two billion people , lower transport costs , better connectivity , and growing transnational social and economic networks could and should lead to increased movement of people .
If this process is allowed to take its course , it will stimulate global growth and serve to reduce poverty .
And yet , while the incremental reduction of barriers to cross ##AT##-##AT## border flows of capital , goods , and services has been a major achievement of recent decades , international migration has never been more strictly controlled .
The classical economists such as John Stuart Mill saw this as both economically illogical and ethically unacceptable .
Adam Smith objected to anything that obstructed “ the free circulation of labor from one employment to another . ”
By the nineteenth century , the development of steam and other transport meant that one ##AT##-##AT## third of the population of Scandinavia , Ireland , and parts of Italy emigrated .
Mass migration gave millions of Europeans an escape route from poverty and persecution , and fed the dynamism and development of countries like the United States , the United Kingdom , and various colonies .
The rise of nationalism prior to the outbreak of World War I led to the widespread introduction of passports and ushered in stricter controls on the international movement of people .
A hundred years later , despite falling barriers to trade , finance , and information , the walls to free mobility have been built higher .
Approximately 200 million people , around 3 % of the world ’ s population , now live in countries in which they were not born .
These are the orphans of the international system .
In our book Exceptional People , we demonstrate that , on balance , they bring great benefit to their host societies .
In addition to providing a much ##AT##-##AT## needed source of skilled and unskilled labor , they contribute disproportionately to innovation and wealth creation .
For example , immigrants to the US contribute more than half of the patents and Silicon Valley start ##AT##-##AT## ups .
They also contribute more in tax than they claim through social ##AT##-##AT## welfare benefits or other payments .
Medical and public health advances have increased longevity in developed countries , while persistently low fertility levels and the end of the post ##AT##-##AT## WWII baby boom mean that the number of native ##AT##-##AT## born workers will fall in the coming years .
As countries ’ populations age and their fertility rates collapse , more migration will be necessary to ensure economic competitiveness and finance pension and health ##AT##-##AT## care systems .
The effects of a shrinking labor force will be compounded by rising educational attainment in developed countries , which will leave fewer people interested in taking on low ##AT##-##AT## skilled service jobs or in working in the trades and construction .
Between 2005 and 2025 , OECD countries are expected to experience a 35 % increase in the percentage of their workforces with tertiary education .
As education levels rise , so do expectations about work .
For the countries they leave , migrants often represent a brain drain .
Even so , they contribute significantly to their home countries .
Taiwan and Israel are testimony to the role played by migrants abroad , with their diasporas playing a vital role in terms of political support , investment flows , and technology transfer .
Moreover , migration has historically been the most effective measure against poverty .
Remittances sent home by migrants exceeded $ 440 billion in 2010 , with over two ##AT##-##AT## thirds of these flows going to developing countries .
In a number of small developing countries , remittances contribute more than one ##AT##-##AT## third of GDP , and in a number of larger countries , annual receipts exceed $ 50 billion .
In Latin America and the Caribbean , more than 50 million people are supported by remittances , and the numbers are even greater in Africa and Asia .
Both rich and poor countries would benefit from increased migration , with developing countries benefiting the most .
It is estimated that increasing migration by just 3 % of the workforce in developed countries between 2005 and 2025 would generate global gains of $ 356 billion , more than two ##AT##-##AT## thirds of which would accrue to developing countries .
Opening borders completely could produce gains as high as $ 39 trillion for the world economy over 25 years .
There has been much discussion of the need to complete the Doha Round of global trade negotiations and increase development assistance to poor countries .
While these actions are vital , putting migration reform on the agenda is as important – a small increase in migration would yield a much greater boon to the global economy and developing countries than the combined benefits of aid and trade reform .
Today , powerful countries argue against migration reform and the development of a rules ##AT##-##AT## based global migration organization .
But more migration is in everyone ’ s interest , and the public debate about it is too important to be left to politicians .
Deep thinking needs to be followed by bold action .
Recent threats by the Bush administration to cut off billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan have sparked panic in government circles .
Likewise , according to the Pakistani ambassador in Washington , military strikes by the United States aimed at al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda and Taliban havens inside Pakistan ’ s tribal areas would destabilize Pakistan and “ possibly could bring &#91; General Pervez Musharraf &#93; down . ”
But how worried should the Pakistani authorities really be in the face of growing US pressure to root out Islamic militants ?
Occasional frustrations notwithstanding , it is , in fact , unlikely that the US will turn against a faithful – and dependent – ally , especially one whose leader enjoys cordial personal relations with Bush .
Nor , due to a lack of organized opposition , will public anger at Musharraf ’ s pro ##AT##-##AT## US policy destabilize his regime .
Indeed , the wily general ##AT##-##AT## president does not merely survive crisis after crisis , but has thrived in power .
How does he do it ?
The answer lies in a finely honed strategy , perfected over years , that juggles US demands and the interests of local intelligence chiefs , mullahs , tribal leaders , venal politicians , and a host of fortune seekers .
Webs of intrigue and murky players obscure details , but the priorities are unmistakeable .
First , American impatience must be held in check .
Pakistan is expected to deliver results on al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda and the Taliban .
However , the pot is not to be emptied all at once .
For example , when US Vice ##AT##-##AT## President Dick Cheney arrived in Islamabad in early March , threatening an aid cut and direct US action against Islamic militants , his message was not lost .
Shortly before his unmarked aircraft landed , Pakistan announced the capture in Quetta of Mullah Obaidullah , deputy to the elusive Taliban chief , Mullah Omar .
Obaidullah carried a $ 1 million reward and was the most senior Taliban captured since November 2001 .
Obaidullah ’ s capture – carried out reluctantly – underscores the Pakistan military ’ s ambiguous relationship with the Taliban .
Despite more than 700 Pakistani combat deaths , many in Musharraf ’ s army wish to retain the Taliban as quasi ##AT##-##AT## allies who – when the Americans leave Afghanistan someday – will give Pakistan the “ strategic depth ” it needs against India .
Thus , to the chagrin of Afghanistan ’ s president , Hamid Karzai , Quetta remains a hub of Taliban opposition to his regime .
A second aspect of Musharraf ’ s strategy is to create mutually beneficial relations with Islamists .
This is a tricky business .
Musharraf cannot permit the mullahs to become too strong .
The mullahs , on the other hand , consider Musharraf an agent of the great Satan , America , and thus a traitor to Islam .
Nevertheless , Musharraf ’ s men have skillfully fractured the main Islamic opposition party , Muttahida Majlis ##AT##-##AT## e-Amal ( MMA ) , with bribes , blackmail , and internal dissension fomented by agent provocateurs .
As part of the trade ##AT##-##AT## off , terrorist leaders who are officially under house arrest – like Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed – remain able to open offices , address rallies , and preach jihad freely .
Such appeasement carries a price .
This is clear in Islamabad , where over the past two months , Kalashnikov ##AT##-##AT## toting students have openly challenged the state , following a government order for the demolition of dozens of illegally built mosques and seminaries .
Unnerved by the wild ##AT##-##AT## eyed students , the government faltered , then surrendered .
In a dramatic reversal , Musharraf ’ s minister of religious affairs , the son of former dictator General Zia ul ##AT##-##AT## Haq , promised to rebuild damaged mosques and even symbolically laid the first stone at one construction site .
The third element of Musharraf ’ s strategy is more positive : he knows that he must do some good – and also be seen doing it .
This is crucial for his image as a newly emerged world leader , promising moderate Islam in an ocean of extremism .
Some of Musharraf ’ s achievements are significant .
Relations with India have improved , the Kashmir insurgency supported by Pakistan has been scaled back , a women ’ s protection bill was passed in the teeth of Islamic opposition , and a virulent public school curriculum that emphasized jihad and martyrdom has been toned down .
But men who live by the gun are willing to die by the gun , and Musharraf is not taking chances .
He knows that the real threat to his power – and his life – comes from within his constituency , the military .
As a result , he has become obsessed with micromanaging everything from troop movements and special events to postings and promotions , all of which require his personal stamp of approval .
Hardline Islamists , favored previously , are now out , and soldiers charged with mutiny have received the death penalty .
Although this has further deepened pro- and anti ##AT##-##AT## US divisions within the army , among both commissioned and non ##AT##-##AT## commissioned officers , Musharraf clearly expects to remain president well beyond the October 2007 elections , as well as to extend further his term of leadership of the army .
To achieve this end , whatever needs to be done will be done ; principles and rules are elastic .
One might have expected the Americans to know better than to bet all on a man who might be gone tomorrow .
But , beyond pumping in dollars and supporting Musharraf and his military , the US appears clueless in dealing with Pakistan and its problems of social development .
With the defeat of al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda and the Taliban America ’ s only visible goal , it is no surprise that the US remains enormously unpopular among Pakistanis , forcing Musharraf to maintain his perilous balancing act .
Since the early 1990s , more foreign direct investment ( FDI ) has flowed into China than to any country except America .
Of this vast capital inflow , overseas Chinese – from Hong Kong , Taiwan , Macao and Southeast Asia – delivered the lion ’ s share .
Investments from Hong Kong and Macao claimed 70 % of Chinese FDI in the early 90s ; since then their share has decreased , yet it still accounts for 50 % of China ’ s total FDI .
That China receives so much capital from expatriates is a global source of envy .
Indian officials bemoan the fact that overseas Indians lack both the wealth and the propensity to invest back home .
Economists and China ##AT##-##AT## watchers celebrate this ready supply of capital , know ##AT##-##AT## how , and marketing channels which enabled China to become – in a short period of time – Asia ’ s manufacturing base and export power ##AT##-##AT## house .
Lavish praise for this stream of expatriate FDI , however , misses its deep flaws .
Yes , expatriate ##AT##-##AT## invested firms produce many Chinese exports , but they often do it by seizing control of export ##AT##-##AT## oriented businesses from indigenous Chinese .
Two ratios tell the story .
One is the export / GDP ratio , which rose from 15 % in 1990 to 20 % in 1999 , an increase of 5 % .
The other is the share of exports by foreign firms of total Chinese exports : this rose from 15 % to almost 40 % during the same period .
So , foreign firms may create exports for China , but they also divert a big slice of the export pie away from indigenous Chinese entrepreneurs .
Expatriate control of so much export ##AT##-##AT## oriented businesses reflects a fundamental failing in China ’ s financial system .
China may have the second highest savings rate in the world , lagging behind only Singapore , but these funds are usually wasted on inefficient state ##AT##-##AT## owned enterprises ( SOEs ) .
These investments have failed to increase the competitiveness of Chinese SOEs , yet have starved efficient local entrepreneurs of the credits they need .
As a result , expatriate Chinese investors buy up businesses controlled by indigenous entrepreneurs on the cheap because the money they bring is the only source of funds available for business expansion .
China ’ s ability to attract so much export ##AT##-##AT## oriented FDI is thus a warning that there is something very wrong with the financial system .
Discrimination against indigenous private entrepreneurs in China goes beyond finance .
Until recently , private Chinese firms could not export directly to foreign buyers and could not retain foreign exchange earnings .
But if you are in the export business , you need foreign exchange to import designs or intermediate inputs .
The restriction of access to foreign exchange made it impossible for private entrepreneurs to run independent export businesses .
Chinese law also discriminated against local export businesses .
Foreign investors often complain that their property rights go unprotected .
True , perhaps , but private Chinese entrepreneurs get a far worse deal .
As early as 1982 , China ’ s Constitution contained a clause to protect property rights of foreign investors ; domestic private entrepreneurs were not offered the same protection until 1999 !
Supposedly , the match between China ’ s cheap labor costs and the entrepreneurship of expatriate Chinese investors is made in heaven .
The problem with this view is that it implies that indigenous Chinese entrepreneurs are somehow incompetent .
What matters about FDI is not only that foreign money comes into China , but also that it brings foreign control of business .
And foreign control only makes sense if it brings in the management know ##AT##-##AT## how that local entrepreneurs lack .
Is this a plausible explanation as to why Chinese entrepreneurs cede control to expatriates ?
A look at other countries may be instructive .
Native Indian and Turkish entrepreneurs run successful export garment businesses in their countries and contract with foreign buyers to sell goods .
The foreign buyers provide designs and even raw materials , while domestic entrepreneurs put them together according to required specifications .
Unless Chinese entrepreneurs are more incompetent than their Indian and Turkish counterparts - and no one suggests that – there is no reason why expatriate Chinese cannot contract with indigenous entrepreneurs to produce goods for export .
The difference is that FDI brings not only a business opportunity but also financing to liquidity ##AT##-##AT## starved Chinese entrepreneurs , whereas a contract only brings forth a business opportunity .
China ’ s entrepreneurs lack money , not talent .
In fact , in some areas , Chinese entrepreneurs should know more than expatriates . Take traditional handicrafts like jade and ivory carving .
In 1995 , there were some 900 foreign ##AT##-##AT## controlled firms producing traditional Chinese handicrafts ; the average foreign equity share was 88 % .
Thus , in industries in which Chinese have excelled for thousands of years , foreign control is now almost absolute .
Cheap labor is the least plausible argument why so much export ##AT##-##AT## oriented FDI has gone to China .
FDI is not the only form of cross ##AT##-##AT## border economic transaction .
A Hong Kong firm can contract out its production in Guangdong province to reap the same labor ##AT##-##AT## savings benefits it would gain from investing in China .
Cheap labor explains why expatriate Chinese seek to produce in China ; it does not explain why their investments are so sought after by the Chinese .
As China nears membership in the WTO , its political and administrative apparatus is mobilizing to improve the investment environment and property rights for foreign investors .
But why not look after the interests of domestic entrepreneurs as well ?
The most urgent task for China ’ s government is not WTO membership , but improving the political , regulatory and financial treatment of Chinese entrepreneurs , who are as talented , innovative and hard working as their expatriate counterparts .
There is no compelling reason why they should lose control of their businesses – often at fire ##AT##-##AT## sale prices – to overseas cousins on so massive a scale .
Marks &amp; Spencer , a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout Britain , recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea , totaling 38 lines , to Fairtrade , a marketing symbol of “ ethical production . ”
The chain already sells only Fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 Café Revive coffee shops .
It is also boosting its purchases of shirts and other goods made with Fairtrade cotton .
The announcement came during “ Fairtrade Fortnight , ” a two ##AT##-##AT## week promotion of Fairtrade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries , telling Britons how Fairtrade has assisted their communities .
The movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well , as consumers increasingly turn to organic , locally produced foods , and eggs from hens not kept in cages .
In the UK , a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers .
There is no comparable US research , but related data , and discussions with my own students , suggests that the figure would be much lower .
Traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage .
For example , the minimum price for coffee is $ 1.26 per pound , no matter how low the market price may fall .
If the market price rises above that figure , the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher .
Small farmers , for their part , are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation .
Plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages , comply with health , safety , and environmental standards , allow unions or other forms of workers ’ associations , provide good housing if workers are not living at home , and do not use child labor or forced labor .
Not every one approves of Fairtrade .
Brink Lindsey , director of the pro ##AT##-##AT## market Cato Institute ’ s Center for Trade Policy Studies , believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a “ well ##AT##-##AT## meaning dead end . ”
With some justification , he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals , but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam , combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply .
In Lindsey ’ s view , if we want to assist coffee growers , we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops – and here he rightly points to rich nations ’ trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled – or to move into higher ##AT##-##AT## value products , like specialty coffees , that bring higher prices .
What is curious about Lindsey ’ s argument , however , is that the Fairtrade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommends – encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that brings a higher price .
Pro ##AT##-##AT## market economists don ’ t object to corporations that blatantly use snob appeal to promote their products .
If people want to pay $ 48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that ’ s what James Bond prefers , economists don ’ t object that the market is being distorted .
So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $ 12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals , under shade trees that help birds to survive , by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children ?
Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children , you can pay $ 10 for a pound of non ##AT##-##AT## Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $ 2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children .
That ’ s a possible strategy , but there are advantages to Fairtrade .
The growers know that they have to provide a product that consumers like , both for its taste and for the way it is grown .
If their product sells well , they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world .
From the growers ’ perspective , receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce .
Paying more for a Fairtrade label is no more “ anti ##AT##-##AT## market ” than paying more for a Gucci label , and it reflects better ethical priorities .
Fairtrade is not a government subsidy .
Its success depends on market demand , not political lobbying .
Fortunately , in Europe , that market demand is growing rapidly .
One hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world , and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending .
We petitioned Nigeria &apos;s Federal High Court last May to review the decision of Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo to grant refugee status to former Liberian President Charles Taylor , who is a fugitive from war crimes charges brought by a United Nations ##AT##-##AT## backed Special Court in Sierra Leone .
We are two of Taylor &apos;s many victims .
Seven years ago , we were young Nigerian businessmen trading in electronic hardware and medical equipment on Africa &apos;s West coast .
We procured our supplies in Nigeria and exported them to Liberia and Sierra Leone .
In the summer of 1997 , David was in Monrovia when Charles Taylor was inaugurated President of Liberia following an eight ##AT##-##AT## year civil war .
One year later , the UN and the Economic Community of West African States deployed soldiers as peacekeepers in neighboring Sierra Leone to guarantee a ceasefire in that country &apos;s near ##AT##-##AT## decade ##AT##-##AT## long conflict , instigated by rebels of the Revolutionary United Front .
In the fall of 1998 , we traveled separately on business trips to Freetown , the capital of Sierra Leone .
On previous visits , we had heard reports of atrocities committed by RUF rebels , including amputations , rapes , and mutilations of civilians in the countryside .
But the presence of the international community reassured us that it was safe to do business in the country .
Both our home government and friends in Sierra Leone agreed .
We planned to spend the Christmas and New Year holidays in Freetown before returning to Nigeria early in 1999 .
Then our plans went awry .
Shortly before Christmas , rumors of an impending rebel assault began to filter into Sierra Leone &apos;s capital .
First a trickle , then a deluge of internally displaced persons arrived .
We tried to change our flights and return to Nigeria , but there were no flights available .
On January 6 , the rebels overran the home where we were staying in Freetown .
We were among nine Nigerians staying there .
The rebels - over one hundred of them , many young teenagers - surrounded our building , set it on fire , and ordered all Nigerians to come out .
Their commander , who spoke with a distinct Liberian accent , called himself Captain Goldteeth .
When we tried to escape , the rebels captured us .
Captain Goldteeth had us brought to a bus terminal next to our residence , where more than 80 other captives were assembled .
He said that he had instructions - from the Executive Mansion in Monrovia - to send a message to Nigeria , the leading troop contributor and financier of the regional peacekeeping force , ECOMOG .
Captain Goldteeth asked the &quot; cut ##AT##-##AT## hand ##AT##-##AT## cut ##AT##-##AT## foot man &quot; to separate Nigerians from the others .
Then they began to amputate us .
Their first victim was Emmanuel &apos;s younger brother , Benedict Egbuna .
They cut off his hands from beneath the elbow .
He bled to death in front of his pregnant wife , Zainab , and us before he was dumped behind the house .
Many of our best friends were also mutilated and killed .
Next it was our turn .
The machete cut through Emmanuel &apos;s flesh and bones but did not entirely sever them .
With hands dangling from his arms , the rebels dumped Emmanuel in the cemetery .
They then cut off David &apos;s arms before setting him ablaze .
Neither of us knows how we survived this ordeal .
Benedict Egbuna &apos;s five ##AT##-##AT## year old son , Benedict Jr . , born five months after the slaughter of his father , is a source of comfort to both of us and to all who knew his father .
Someday , when he grows up , Benedict Jr. will look to us to reconstruct the memories of the father he will never know .
At a later point , Benedict will almost certainly also ask us what happened to those responsible for his father &apos;s killing .
What shall we tell him ?
We have a duty to seek justice for the victims of Charles Taylor &apos;s crimes .
Refugee status is a humanitarian shelter .
Nigeria must not let it be used as a tyrant &apos;s shield .
NEW YORK – The United States Federal Reserve ’ s decision to undertake a third round of quantitative easing , or QE3 , has raised three important questions .
Will QE3 jump ##AT##-##AT## start America ’ s anemic economic growth ?
Will it lead to a persistent increase in risky assets , especially in US and other global equity markets ?
Finally , will its effects on GDP growth and equity markets be similar or different ?
Many now argue that QE3 ’ s effect on risky assets should be as powerful , if not more so , than that of QE1 , QE2 , and “ Operation Twist , ” the Fed ’ s earlier bond ##AT##-##AT## purchase program .
After all , while the previous rounds of US monetary easing have been associated with a persistent increase in equity prices , the size and duration of QE3 are more substantial .
But , despite the Fed ’ s impressive commitment to aggressive monetary easing , its effects on the real economy and on US equities could well be smaller and more fleeting than those of previous QE rounds .
Consider , first , that the previous QE rounds came at times of much lower equity valuations and earnings .
In March 2009 , the S &amp; amp ; P 500 index was down to 660 , earnings per share ( EPS ) of US companies and banks had sunk to a financial ##AT##-##AT## crisis low , and price / earnings ratios were in the single digits .
Today , the S &amp; amp ; P 500 is more than 100 % higher ( hovering near 1,430 ) , the average EPS is close to $ 100 , and P / E ratios are above 14 .
Even during QE2 , in the summer of 2010 , the S &amp; amp ; P 500 , P / E ratios , and EPS were much lower than they are today .
If , as is likely , economic growth in the US remains anemic in spite of QE3 , top ##AT##-##AT## line revenues and bottom ##AT##-##AT## line earnings will turn south , with negative effects on equity valuations .
Moreover , fiscal support is absent this time : QE1 and QE2 helped to prevent a deeper recession and avoid a double dip , respectively , because each was associated with a significant fiscal stimulus .
In contrast , QE3 will be associated with a fiscal contraction , possibly even a large fiscal cliff .
Even if the US avoids the full fiscal cliff of 4.5 % of GDP that is looming at the end of the year , it is highly likely that a fiscal drag amounting to 1.5 % of GDP will hit the economy in 2013 .
With the US economy currently growing at a 1.6 % annual rate , a fiscal drag of even 1 % implies near ##AT##-##AT## stagnation in 2013 , though a modest recovery in housing and manufacturing , together with QE3 , should keep US growth at about its current level in 2013 .
But there is no broader rebound underway .
In both 2010 and 2011 , leading economic indicators showed that the first ##AT##-##AT## half slowdown had bottomed out , and that growth was already accelerating before the announcement of monetary easing .
Thus , QE nudged along an economy that was already recovering , which prolonged asset reflation .
By contrast , the latest data suggest that the US economy is performing as sluggishly now as it was in the first half of the year .
Indeed , if anything , weakness in the US labor market , low capital expenditures , and slow income growth have contradicted signals in the early summer that third ##AT##-##AT## quarter growth might be more robust .
Meanwhile , the main transmission channels of monetary stimulus to the real economy – the bond , credit , currency , and stock markets – remain weak , if not broken .
Indeed , the bond ##AT##-##AT## market channel is unlikely to boost growth .
Long ##AT##-##AT## term government bond yields are already very low , and a further reduction will not significantly change private agents ’ borrowing costs .
The credit channel also is not working properly , as banks have hoarded most of the extra liquidity from QE , creating excess reserves rather than increasing lending .
Those who can borrow have ample cash and are cautious about spending , while those who want to borrow – highly indebted households and firms ( especially small and medium ##AT##-##AT## size enterprises ) – face a credit crunch .
The currency channel is similarly impaired .
With global growth weakening , net exports are unlikely to improve robustly , even with a weaker dollar .
Moreover , many major central banks are implementing variants of QE alongside the Fed , dampening the effect of the Fed ’ s actions on the dollar ’ s value .
Perhaps most important , a weaker dollar ’ s effect on the trade balance , and thus on growth , is limited by two factors .
First , a weaker dollar is associated with a higher dollar price for commodities , which implies a drag on the trade balance , because the US is a net commodity ##AT##-##AT## importing country .
Second , any improvement in GDP derived from stronger exports leads to an increase in imports .
Empirical studies estimate that the overall impact of a weaker US dollar on the trade balance is close to zero .
The only other significant channel to transmit QE to the real economy is the wealth effect of an equity ##AT##-##AT## market increase , but there is some circularity in the argument that QE3 will lead to a persistent rise in equity prices .
If persistent asset reflation requires a significant GDP growth recovery , it is tautological to say that if equity prices rise enough following QE , the resulting increase in GDP from a wealth effect justifies the rise in asset prices .
If monetary policy ’ s transmission channels to the real economy are broken , one cannot assume that QE will have a significant effect on economic growth .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has recently emphasized the importance of an additional channel : the confidence channel , through which the Fed ’ s commitment to maintaining generous monetary conditions for longer could improve private spending .
The issue is how substantial and durable such effects will be .
Confidence is fragile in an environment characterized by ongoing deleveraging , macro uncertainties , weak labor ##AT##-##AT## market growth , and a fiscal drag .
In short , QE3 reduces the tail risk of an outright economic contraction , but is unlikely to lead to a sustained recovery in an economy that is still enduring a painful deleveraging process .
In the short run , QE3 will lead investors to take on risk , and will stimulate modest asset reflation .
But the equity ##AT##-##AT## price rise is likely to fizzle out over time if economic growth disappoints , as is likely , and drags down expectations about corporate revenues and profitability .
NEW YORK – December 7 marks the 67th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor .
Over the years , “ the day of infamy ” has become a classic reference point for galvanizing patriotic sentiment in America .
In the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attack , for example , analogies to Pearl Harbor were made frequently .
But despite its central place in America ’ s collective memory , Pearl Harbor remains little understood .
Why did Japan initiate such a seemingly self ##AT##-##AT## destructive war in the first place ?
Aside from lessons that Japan must learn from its momentous decision , is there something to be learned by the United States as well ?
The decision to attack Pearl Harbor was reached after five months of deliberations that included numerous official conferences .
It was a gradual process in which more sympathetic , albeit firm , US engagement might have helped sway Japan in a different direction .
In fact , Japanese government opinion was so divided that it is surprising that it was able to unite in the end .
Many in the Japanese Army initially regarded the Soviet Union as the main threat facing the country .
Others saw the US as the primary enemy .
Some were concerned with more abstract , ideological enemies , such as Communism and “ Americanism , ” while there were also voices highlighting the menace of the “ white race ” ( including Japan ’ s allies , Germany and Italy ) against the “ yellow race . ”
Then there were those who preferred not to fight any enemy at all , particularly the US , whose long ##AT##-##AT## term war ##AT##-##AT## making power , the government knew , far surpassed Japan ’ s own .
The tactical mastermind of the Pearl Harbor operation , Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , was one of them .
Over the course of the summer of 1941 , events slowly tilted Japan towards the possibility of war with the West .
But Pearl Harbor was in no way inevitable .
Germany ’ s attack on the Soviet Union compelled Japan in July 1941 to prepare a plan of attack .
Although it made clear Japan ’ s desire to take advantage of the European conflict and gain a foothold in the European colonies in Southeast Asia , the plan was not clear about who constituted Japan ’ s true enemy .
Japan ’ s military thrust into Southeast Asia led President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ’ s administration to impose sanctions .
The US froze Japanese assets , an example followed by Britain and the Dutch East Indies .
When Japan responded by taking over southern French Indochina , the US retaliated by imposing an embargo on oil exports to Japan .
Rather than telling Japan that the US was determined to search for a diplomatic solution , America ’ s categorical reaction confirmed it to the Japanese as an arrogant and conceited enemy .
Moreover , by transferring its Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor , the US encouraged the Japanese understanding that the US fully anticipated war with Japan .
World War II in the Pacific finally came about for many different reasons .
But it was , above all , the sense of encirclement and humiliation that united the deeply divided Japanese government .
Feeling defeated by a series of failed approaches to the US , including an overture to hold direct talks with Roosevelt , Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned on October 16 , making hard ##AT##-##AT## line Army Minister Hideki Tōjō his successor .
The high ##AT##-##AT## handed tone of the Hull Note of November 26 , demanding Japan ’ s withdrawal of all its troops from China , was a final blow to the moderates in Japan ’ s government , who still hoped for diplomatic negotiations .
By this time , many policymakers were convinced that the US was not ready to hear them out .
It was ultimately in the name of saving Asia for all Asians from what was regarded as Western arrogance that the government united to wage war .
On December 1 , it was decided that the war would commence in six days .
There were legitimate historical reasons for Japan to feel humiliated on the eve of war .
The gunboat diplomacy that resulted in the opening of Japan and unequal treaties in the mid ##AT##-##AT## 19th century was but a beginning .
More immediately , the Great Depression and the subsequent compartmentalization of the world into economic blocs also worked to the advantage of the already powerful .
Coupled with the economic hardship of the interwar years were instances of racial prejudice in the US that aimed at preventing Japanese immigration .
United by this long ##AT##-##AT## simmering and humiliating sense of exclusion , Japanese policymakers , whatever their differences , stumbled toward the December 1 decision to go to war .
With almost 70 years of hindsight , Pearl Harbor should offer some lessons for US foreign policy today .
Despite obvious differences between Pearl Harbor and recent Islamist terrorist tactics , they show the common desire of self ##AT##-##AT## proclaimed Davids to topple their Goliaths in a clearly lop ##AT##-##AT## sided battle .
These Davids depend on Western technologies to overcome imbalances of power , and are driven by a sense of real or imagined humiliation .
But no matter how strong and historically justified such grievances may be those who resort to murderous tactics must be condemned .
However , high ##AT##-##AT## handedness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response , for this approach further humiliates those who already feel humiliated , and alienates those who might otherwise proffer a more moderate voice .
Diplomacy no longer works with terrorism , but it can help to prevent it by dealing carefully with potentially hostile states .
With global expectations mounting for a fresh start in US foreign policy , it is vital not just to remember , but to understand the attack on Pearl Harbor .
NEW YORK – Most people around the world will not be able to vote in the United States ’ s upcoming presidential election , even though they have a great deal at stake in the result .
Overwhelmingly , non ##AT##-##AT## US citizens favor Barack Obama ’ s re ##AT##-##AT## election over a victory for his challenger , Mitt Romney .
There are good reasons for this .
In terms of the economy , the effects of Romney ’ s policies in creating a more unequal and divided society would not be directly felt abroad .
But , in the past , for better and for worse , others have often followed America ’ s example .
Many governments quickly subscribed to Ronald Reagan ’ s mantra of deregulated markets – policies that eventually brought about the worst global recession since the 1930 ’ s .
Other countries that followed America ’ s lead have experienced growing inequality – &amp; nbsp ; more money at the top , more poverty at the bottom , and a weaker middle class .
Romney ’ s proposed contractionary policies – &amp; nbsp ; the attempt to reduce deficits prematurely , while the US economy is still frail – &amp; nbsp ; will almost surely weaken America ’ s already anemic growth , and , if the euro crisis worsens , it could bring on another recession .
At that point , with US demand shrinking , the rest of the world would indeed feel the economic effects of a Romney presidency quite directly .
That raises the question of globalization , which entails concerted action on many fronts by the international community .
But what is required with regard to trade , finance , climate change , and a host other areas is not being done .
Many people attribute these failures partly to an absence of American leadership .
But , while Romney may summon bravado and strong rhetoric , other world leaders would be unlikely to follow him , owing to the belief ( correct in my judgment ) that he would take the US – and them – in the wrong direction .
American “ exceptionalism ” may sell well at home , but it does poorly abroad .
President George W. Bush ’ s Iraq war – arguably a violation of international law – &amp; nbsp ; showed that though America spends almost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined , it could not pacify a country with less than 10 % of its population and less than 1 % of its GDP .
Moreover , it turned out that US ##AT##-##AT## style capitalism was neither efficient nor stable .
With most Americans ’ incomes stagnating for a decade and a half , it was clear that the US economic model was not delivering for most citizens , whatever official GDP data said .
Indeed , the model blew up even before Bush left office .
Together with the abuses of human rights under his administration , the Great Recession – the predictable ( and predicted ) consequence of his economic policies – did as much to weaken America ’ s soft power as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan did to weaken the credibility of its military power .
In terms of values – namely , the values of Romney and his running mate , Paul Ryan – things are not much better .
For example , every other advanced country recognizes the right to accessible health care , and Obama ’ s Affordable Care Act represents a significant step toward that goal .
But Romney has criticized this effort , and has offered nothing in its place .
America now has the distinction of being among the advanced countries that afford the least equality of opportunity to their citizens .
And Romney ’ s drastic budget cutbacks , targeted at the poor and middle class , would further impede social mobility .
At the same time , he would expand the military , spending more money on weapons that do not work against enemies that do not exist , enriching defense contractors like Halliburton at the expense of desperately needed public investment in infrastructure and education .
While Bush is not on the ballot , Romney has not really distanced himself from the Bush administration ’ s policies .
On the contrary , his campaign has featured the same advisers , the same devotion to higher military spending , the same belief that tax cuts for the rich are the solution to every economic problem , and the same fuzzy budget math .
Consider , for example , the three issues that are at the center of the global agenda mentioned earlier : climate change , financial regulation , and trade .
Romney has been silent on the first , and many in his party are “ climate deniers . ”
The world cannot expect genuine leadership from Romney there .
As for financial regulation , while the recent crisis has highlighted the need for stricter rules , agreement on many issues has proven to be elusive , partly because the Obama administration is too close to the financial sector .
With Romney , though , there would be no distance at all : metaphorically speaking , he is the financial sector .
One financial issue on which there is global agreement is the need to close down offshore bank havens , which exist mainly for purposes of tax evasion and avoidance , money laundering , and corruption .
Money does not go to the Cayman Islands because sunshine makes it grow faster ; this money thrives on the absence of sunshine .
But , with Romney unapologetic about his own use of Cayman banks , we are unlikely to see progress even in this area .
On trade , Romney promises to launch a trade war with China , and to declare it a currency manipulator on Day One – a promise that gives him little wiggle room .
He refuses to note the renminbi ’ s large real appreciation in recent years , or to acknowledge that , while changes in China ’ s exchange rate may affect the bilateral trade deficit , what matters is America ’ s multilateral trade deficit .
A stronger renminbi would simply mean a switch in the US from China to lower ##AT##-##AT## cost producers of textiles , apparel , and other goods .
The irony – &amp; nbsp ; again lost on Romney – is that other countries are accusing the US of currency manipulation .
After all , one of the main benefits of the Federal Reserve ’ s policy of “ quantitative easing ” – perhaps the only channel with a significant effect on the real economy – derives from the depreciation of the US dollar .
The world has a lot riding on America ’ s election .
Unfortunately , most people who will be affected by it – almost the entire world – will have no influence on the outcome .
Competition policy is the European Union &apos;s biggest success .
The reason is simple : decisions in this area have been removed from the jurisdiction of individual nations , thus making them more difficult to influence .
The result is that the many lobbies that oppose increased competition , or fight to protect state aid , have been hugely weakened .
But has the anti ##AT##-##AT## trust fight gone too far ?
The executive powers that the European Commission enjoys over competition policy allow it to circumvent the national vetoes and compromises that are common in other areas .
For example , implementation of rules governing the single market are subject to a unanimity rule , or at the very least a qualified majority of member states , with the result that progress is usually slow .
The European Commission recently lost much of its standing in the eyes of ordinary Europeans with the vitriolic fights between the Council and the Commission over the defunct Stability Pact and the failure to approve the draft constitution .
So it is vital that the Commission &apos;s reputation in the area of competition policy shine because this reputation is the Union &apos;s most precious capital ; this is no time to waste it .
However , excessive zeal and pursuit of cases with dubious economic justification , as has sometimes happened in merger cases , can do serious damage .
Those who argue for the protection of state aid , for instance , immediately use an unfortunate decision in the merger area : see , they say , how stupid the Commission is at economics !
Examples of this include the decisions to veto the merger between Airtours and First Choice , and also between Tetra Laval and Sidel - decisions that where based on dubious arguments and were eventually reversed by the European Court of Justice , with serious damage to the Commission &apos;s credibility .
The recent decision to fine Ryanair , Europe &apos;s main budget airline , for its arrangement with local officials in using Charleroi as its main airport in Belgium , is another example of an unfortunate decision that could undermine the Commission &apos;s reputation .
Here are the facts : Charleroi was a small dusty airport with less than 200,000 passengers per year .
Ryanair proposed a deal : the airport forgoes its landing fees , and in exchange Ryanair flies in two million people per year .
The deal was signed and almost everybody was happy : passengers who fly cheaply ; the airport , where the number of shops increased along with the number of passengers ; the local community , where new jobs were created .
The unhappy exceptions , of course , were the big airlines that charge ten times as much as Ryanair and were losing business .
But Charleroi is state ##AT##-##AT## owned .
State ##AT##-##AT## owned , said Brussels ?
Then foregoing landing fees is tantamount to giving Ryanair state aid - the presumption being that the lost revenue must be coming at the expense of Belgian taxpayers .
So the Commission asked Ryanair to pay back most of the forgone fees , and announced that it will review the airline &apos;s terms of operation at other European airports as well .
The outcome may well be the demise of Ryanair .
Michael O &apos;Leary , the CEO of Ryanair , is a visionary .
In an interview last summer , he depicted a world in which people would fly free and airlines would charge airports in exchange for the millions of passengers they deliver to their shops .
This is the best possible world for passengers , since nobody forces anyone to spend money in an airport ; people do it only because it is convenient .
Even leaving aside this vision , Ryanair succeeded in providing cheap fares in a European travel market that not long ago was prohibitively expensive .
Ryanair has been a champion of increasing competition in the airline industry , forcing other carriers to reduce fares .
Punishing this airline will only reduce competition in the airline industry , an outcome that , Mario Monti , the EU competition commissioner , and Loyola de Palacio , the EU transport commissioner , cannot possibly want .
Obviously , one may object that if the Commission lowers its guard on state aid once , then &quot; everything may go . &quot;
So how can the Commission distinguish between cases ?
Our answer is that there should be a presumption that state aid to any industry or specific company must be subject to prohibition .
This simple principle should guide Commission competition decisions .
Only in exceptional cases can this presumption be overturned .
Ryanair is probably one of these exceptional cases .
After all , there was a far better solution than punishing the airline : force Belgium to privatise the airport .
Once private , Charleroi airport could sign any agreement it wishes , with Ryanair or any other airline .
Here , however , we hit a soft spot : European treaties protect competition , but are neutral vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis state ownership of companies .
Brussels cannot force a member country to privatize : it can only force it to run a state ##AT##-##AT## owned company as if it were a private corporation .
This is difficult , because getting rid of the implicit guarantee enjoyed by a state ##AT##-##AT## owned company is virtually impossible .
Drafters of the next rendition of the European Constitution should take notice .
WASHINGTON , DC – June 12 marks the first anniversary of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’ s disputed re ##AT##-##AT## election as Iran ’ s president .
Despite the Iranian opposition ’ s continuing efforts to contest the outcome and advance political liberalization , Ahmadinejad and his allies have largely succeeded in consolidating their hold on power by using brute force to repress the reform movement . Hopes that a popular uprising might topple the regime have fizzled .
Meanwhile , the crisis over Iran ’ s nuclear program is escalating .
The Iranian regime continues to defy the international community ’ s efforts to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons .
In response , US President Barack Obama ’ s administration has been working through the United Nations Security Council to impose tougher economic sanctions . Nonetheless , Iran edges toward mastering the process of enriching uranium to weapons ##AT##-##AT## grade purity .
The closer Iran gets to developing a nuclear weapon , the greater the likelihood that Israel , with or without US help , might attack Iran ’ s nuclear facilities .
The Iranian government ’ s intransigence , its blatant efforts to mislead nuclear inspectors , its odious calls for the destruction of Israel , its brutal repression of political opponents – all provide good reason for Obama to slam the door shut on dialogue .
With diplomacy having failed to curb Iran ’ s nuclear ambitions , critics of engagement charge , it is time to resort to coercion before Iran crosses the nuclear Rubicon .
A rising chorus of voices now forswears engagement with Iran ’ s rulers , insisting that it is time for the regime to go .
But closing off dialogue with Iran would be a precipitous and dangerous mistake .
As my new book , How Enemies Become Friends , confirms , even fierce adversaries can settle their differences through negotiation .
For four compelling reasons , the US and its allies should keep the door open to dialogue until the eleventh hour .
First , tighter sanctions make sense only as a diplomatic tool , not as a blunt instrument of coercion .
The new sanctions simply are not severe enough to intimidate Iran into submission , and more restrictive ones would not pass muster within the Security Council .
Accordingly , if tougher sanctions prove to be useful , they will do so by confronting Iran with a united diplomatic front , thereby encouraging its government to make a deal in order to end the country ’ s isolation .
New sanctions are warranted , but as a complement , not an alternative , to diplomacy .
Second , the costs of abandoning diplomacy are so high that continued engagement makes sense even as Iran refuses to budge .
To give up on diplomacy is to leave the international community with two ugly options : living with a nuclear Iran or carrying out a preventive military strike against Iran ’ s nuclear installations .
Should Iran possess the ultimate weapon , it might embrace a new restraint in its foreign policy ; nuclear ##AT##-##AT## weapons states , precisely because they confront the prospect of nuclear retaliation , have historically tread with caution .
But the Iranian regime is no ordinary government ; it may not adhere to the normal practices of nuclear restraint .
Even if it does , a nuclear Iran may trigger an arms race in the region and embolden an Iranian government that already supports extremist movements throughout the Middle East .
An American security umbrella over the Persian Gulf and Israel might calm nerves , but it would do little to counter increased Iranian support of Islamic radicals .
A military strike would likely have worse consequences .
Even if a strike was an operational success , it would only set back Iran ’ s nuclear program by several years – while giving the regime a new incentive to acquire a nuclear deterrent and build better hidden and defended nuclear facilities .
In response to an attack , Iran might well seek to obstruct shipping in the Persian Gulf , potentially triggering oil shortages and soaring prices .
Iran could also intensify efforts to fund and arm insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan , imperiling both countries .
And it could launch attacks on US , European , and Israeli targets on a global basis .
Such prospects make continued diplomacy , however elusive the prospects of success , nothing short of mandatory .
The third reason for pursuing dialogue is that factional infighting and political intrigue within the Iranian regime make for considerable political fluidity .
Admittedly , turmoil in Tehran brings inconstancy to Iran ’ s foreign policy , warranting caution about the prospects for a meaningful diplomatic breakthrough .
But internal jockeying for power also means that a coalitional alignment favoring a negotiated settlement just might fall into place .
Ahmadinejad himself , after all , late last year voiced enthusiasm for a Western proposal to break the logjam by exporting Iran ’ s uranium for processing abroad , only to reverse course soon thereafter . Then last month , he reversed course again , working with Brazil and Turkey to craft a watered ##AT##-##AT## down version of the original proposal .
Ahmadinejad may be bobbing and weaving . But his mercurial ways make it plausible that he may find it politically advantageous to strike a serious bargain on the nuclear issue . Just in case , the diplomatic door should remain ajar .
Finally , even as stalemate continues on Iran ’ s uranium enrichment , continued engagement may offer a roundabout means of arriving at a bargain on the nuclear issue .
Dialogue with the US could focus on areas , such as Iraq and Afghanistan , where the two parties share a measure of common ground .
Joint efforts to combat drug trafficking in Afghanistan , for example , could help dilute the mutual antagonism and distrust that contribute to blockage on the nuclear front .
Iran remains several years away from mastering the technology needed to build nuclear weapons , which provides time to search for such diplomatic openings .
With Iran having spurned Obama ’ s offers of compromise , it is tempting for the US administration to turn its back on dialogue .
But the stakes are too high to abandon engagement .
Even with new sanctions in the offing , dialogue still offers the best prospect for peacefully resolving what may be the world ’ s most dangerous dispute .
LONDON – It seemed that a new model for global governance had been forged in the white heat of the financial crisis .
But now that the ashes are cooling , different perspectives on bank regulation are emerging on either side of the Atlantic .
The emphasis in Europe has been on regulating financial markets with a view to moderating future crises .
Credit mistakes are made during the boom , not during the crash , so the argument goes .
Better regulation and monetary policy during the boom years , therefore , could limit the scale of any bust .
By contrast , the emphasis in the United States has been on finding market ##AT##-##AT## friendly ways to contain spillovers from bank failure .
Policy debates in the US are chiefly preoccupied with ensuring that banks are never “ too big to fail ” ; that private investors rather than taxpayers hold “ contingent capital , ” which in a crash can be converted into equity ; and that “ over ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## counter ” markets ’ functioning be improved through greater reliance on centralized trading , clearing , and settlements .
The chief point of intersection between the European and US approaches is major banks .
This convergence has less to do with regulatory thinking on bank size or function than with a common need to play to the political gallery and raise more tax revenue .
Banks ’ balance sheets are systemically dangerous when bloated by leverage , and it is this that regulatory or fiscal policy should address through liquidity buffers and leverage ratios .
After all , it is the contagiousness of financial crises , not banks ’ size , that matters .
Any list conjured up in 2006 of institutions that were “ too big to fail ” would not have included Northern Rock , Bradford &amp; amp ; Bingley , IKB , Bear Sterns , or even Lehman Brothers .
Banks lend to banks , so while some are more illiquid than others , they are all intrinsically illiquid institutions .
Small failures can give birth to large panics , which means that in a crisis almost everyone is “ too big to fail . ”
The reality is that we can have as large a financial boom and subsequent bust as we just experienced , resulting in the same economic misery , in a world made up only of small banks .
Many argue that bankers ’ belief that their institutions are too big to fail and that their jobs are safe encourages them to underestimate the risks that they assume .
But if that belief dominated bankers ’ thinking , they would still worry about their savings .
In other words , they would not wrap themselves up in their institutions ’ equity and the leveraged products they were selling .
Yet they did .
The revealed preference of banks ’ and bankers ’ behavior is that they did not lend more because they thought they could get away with it , but because they thought it was safe .
They were fools more than knaves .
The main driver of excessive lending and leverage is a mistaken view of risk that is shared by everyone .
The riskiest institutions were not the largest : firms like J. P. Morgan and HSBC proved safer than others , and neither sought nor needed state funding .
Those that failed were relatively small , like IKB , Bear Sterns , and so on .
Big banks like the idea that regulation should care less about banks ’ size and more about their riskiness , and so champion a “ risk ##AT##-##AT## sensitive ” approach – not least because they have the bigger risk ##AT##-##AT## management operations and databases , so risk ##AT##-##AT## sensitive regulation is more onerous for their smaller competitors .
But this approach suffers from a fatal fallacy : if booms are fueled by underestimation of risks , and regulation is made more sensitive to the estimation of risks , booms will be bigger and busts deeper .
A better argument for curbing bank size is the excessive influence of big banks on policy.What policymakers should therefore be looking for is regulation that makes the financial system less sensitive to error in markets ’ estimation of risk , not more so .
There are two ways to do this .
The first is to observe that this error is correlated with the boom ##AT##-##AT## bust cycle .
Booms have similar characteristics – strong growth in banks ’ balance sheets and credit , and therefore a rise in leverage .
These trends imply an increased probability that the market is underestimating risk , so systemic risk regulators should raise minimum capital requirements as soon as they spot them .
Counter ##AT##-##AT## cyclical capital requirements fit with this idea , and a range of indicators could be used to calibrate the increase in capital requirements , coupled perhaps with some discretion .
There are many reasons why the market fails to correct systemic error , including that booms are always founded on a belief by both regulators and bankers that “ this time it is different . ”
Let ’ s not forget the essays in central banks ’ stability reports on how credit derivatives were benefiting the financial sector .
The second way to reduce the financial system ’ s sensitivity to risk ##AT##-##AT## estimation errors is to limit the flow of risks to institutions with a structural , rather than a statistical , capacity for holding that risk .
That way , when the risk modelers get it wrong , we will be in less trouble .
Credit risk is best hedged through diversification across uncorrelated credits .
Liquidity risk is best hedged through diversification across time .
Market risk is best hedged through a combination of diversification across assets and enough time to decide when to sell .
In the past , risks with volatility of similar statistical magnitudes were considered to be fungible , and , could flow to whomever was prepared to bear them .
But , while banks with short ##AT##-##AT## term funding and many branches originating loans have a deep capacity for holding credit risks , they have a limited capacity for holding market risks , and little capacity for holding liquidity risk .
Insurance companies and pension funds , on the other hand , have limited capacity for credit risk , but more for market and liquidity risks .
The lesson for regulators is simple : capacity for risk is related to the maturity of funding , not to what an institution is called .
BRUSSELS – As Europe picks over the ruins of the mega ##AT##-##AT## merger that would have created a world ##AT##-##AT## beating new aerospace and defense giant , questions are being asked about the inglorious role that the European Union played in the fiasco .
The European Commission ’ s failure to champion the $ 50 billion merger of the Franco ##AT##-##AT## German European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company ( EADS ) , owner of Airbus , and the United Kingdom ’ s BAE Systems is being seen as a crucial factor in the deal ’ s collapse .
The integration of the two high ##AT##-##AT## tech aviation and avionics leaders had looked like an EU ##AT##-##AT## inspired blueprint for industrial success .
For several years , EU leaders have been urging the consolidation of Europe ’ s defense industries , so the proposed deal – which originated in the corporate boardrooms of EADS and BAE Systems – looked like an answer to their calls .
Yet both the Commission and the European Parliament kept silent and withheld the political support that might have ensured that the deal went through .
A timely reminder by EU leaders of the strategic importance of the aerospace sector would have helped allay many of the misgivings in Berlin , and to a lesser degree in London , that ultimately sank the deal .
Aviation , like defense , is the sharpest of the R &amp; amp ; D cutting edges available to advanced countries , and regularly produces key technological breakthroughs .
Nationalist squabbles over the details of the merger would surely have been attenuated by a statesmanlike intervention from the Commission in Brussels .
It was therefore a bizarre coincidence that the merger ’ s collapse came on the day that the Commission unveiled its new industrial strategy for regaining Europe ’ s competitive edge in the face of Asian and North American competition .
One of the most powerful arguments for the EADS ##AT##-##AT## BAE marriage had been the expectation of industry analysts that within 20 years China will challenge Airbus and Boeing in the global aviation market , while also creating a powerful new defense industry .
That scenario now looks all the more likely .
Why , then , did the European Commission remain silent ?
The answer appears to be that it feared negative reactions from the three governments involved in the merger talks , and believed that its own authority would suffer from any public rebuff .
The persistent rumor circulating among defense company executives is that soon after news of the proposed merger leaked , the weekly commissioners ’ meeting chaired by Commission President José Manuel Barroso was enjoined to keep silent on the matter in order to avoid any potential dangers .
Whether true or not , the important point is that the merger transcended national considerations , and the European Commission had a duty to involve itself .
The EU ’ s executive body is meant to be the driving force behind Europe ’ s efforts to revive laggard industries and fight to reverse the long ##AT##-##AT## term economic decline that the eurozone crisis appears to presage .
Nobody is arguing that the Commission is responsible for the deal ’ s unhappy end – only that it should have rallied support for it .
The significance of the merger ’ s collapse is now becoming clear to observers across Europe , especially in Germany , where the media have been extremely critical of how “ negative politics ” sealed the proposed merger ’ s fate .
With the EU in the throes of the seemingly endless eurozone sovereign ##AT##-##AT## debt crisis and facing a looming debate over its future decision ##AT##-##AT## making architecture , the collapse of the EADS ##AT##-##AT## BAE merger will be no more than a footnote in the history books .
But it may be said to mark the point when the European Commission openly acknowledged that it has become little more than a secretariat to EU governments .
That is a far cry from the political powerhouse that some Europeans fear – and for which others still hope .
Just when the smoke from Turkey ’ s domestic political conflicts of the past year had begun to clear , another deadly attack by Kurdish separatists on Turkish soldiers has the government threatening military attacks inside northern Iraq .
That prospect raises risks for Turkey , Iraq , and the United States .
But there are reasons to doubt that the situation is as dangerous as recent headlines suggest .
Turkey accuses Iraqi Kurds of harboring between 3,000 and 3,500 of Turkey ’ s most active Kurdish militants – the PKK separatist guerillas who are blamed for the deaths of 80 Turkish soldiers so far this year .
The trouble reached the boiling point on October 7 , when Kurdish fighters killed 13 Turkish soldiers near Turkey ’ s border with Iraq .
The Turkish public has demanded action , and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’ s government has responded .
On October 17 , despite pleas for patience and restraint from Iraq and the US , Turkish lawmakers voted 507 ##AT##-##AT## 19 to authorize Erdogan to order cross ##AT##-##AT## border military strikes into Iraq at any time over the next year .
Erdogan has sent Iraqi Kurds a forceful message .
But , for several reasons , the Turkish military is likely to limit its operations to small ##AT##-##AT## scale incursions and air strikes on specific targets rather than launch an all ##AT##-##AT## out war .
First , the Turkish military has no interest in embracing the risks that come with involvement in Iraq ’ s sectarian strife .
A full ##AT##-##AT## scale invasion might well provoke Iraq ’ s own Kurdish guerrillas into a prolonged and bloody battle with Turkish forces that can only undermine support for Erdogan ’ s government at home and abroad .
Second , Turkey ’ s government hopes to keep the country ’ s bid to join the European Union moving forward .
An invasion of Iraq would bring that process to a grinding halt .
EU Foreign Policy chief Javier Solana has made plain that Europe strongly opposes any large ##AT##-##AT## scale Turkish military operation in Iraq .
Third , Turkey is well aware that an all ##AT##-##AT## out attack inside Iraq is exactly what Turkey ’ s Kurdish separatists want .
What better way to damage Turkey than to pull its military into conflict with Iraq , the US , and the EU ?
Erdogan has no intention of being drawn into that trap .
With all that in mind , this latest move by Turkey ’ s parliament should be seen more as an ultimatum to Iraq ’ s Kurdish Regional Government to expel the Turkish Kurds and an attempt to persuade the US to use its considerable influence there .
That ’ s hardball politics , not a declaration of war .
The parliamentary authorization itself is carefully worded to underline Turkey ’ s limited aims .
It stresses that Turkey ’ s military has no intention of occupying Iraqi territory or threatening Iraqi Kurds or their oil infrastructure .
An attack would certainly make Iraq ’ s Kurdish provinces less appealing for foreign investors . But Turkey has no reason to attack the assets of foreign oil companies .
Iraq ’ s central government is aware of the risks , as well , and is likely to exercise maximum restraint .
A limited Turkish strike into northern Iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of Iraqi sovereignty .
Threats to Iraq ’ s oil infrastructure around the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk and other territory under the Kurdish Regional Government ’ s control are minimal .
Turkey ’ s government knows that any move to shut down the 600 ##AT##-##AT## mile pipeline from Kirkuk to Turkey ’ s Mediterranean port at Ceyhan would have little near ##AT##-##AT## term impact , since most of Iraq ’ s oil exports flow from the south , hundreds of miles from the country ’ s border with Turkey .
Furthermore , the Turkish military can increase the pressure on Iraqi Kurds with far less drastic measures .
It can close the two countries ’ principal border crossing , an important route for food , fuel , and other goods headed for Iraqi Kurds .
It could also cut exports of electricity to northern Iraq .
Still , even small ##AT##-##AT## scale military operations would generate risk .
If the PKK is able to launch a major attack on troops or civilians inside Turkey , the public outcry might leave Erdogan with little choice but to up the ante .
The issue is complicated further by Turkey ’ s refusal to negotiate directly with the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq .
Such talks , Turkey fears , would offer tacit acknowledgement that Iraqi Kurds have won a degree of autonomy from Baghdad .
That ’ s a bridge too far for Turkey ’ s nationalists and its military .
There are risks for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki as well , because Turkish military strikes on Iraq ’ s northern provinces could undermine the Kurdish support on which his government increasingly depends .
Both Sunni Arabs and Kurds already resent al Maliki ’ s mild reaction to Iran ’ s recent shelling of Iraqi territory – an attempt to strike at Iranian Kurdish militants fleeing across its border with Iraq .
There are also risks for the US .
Most supplies headed for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan move through the Incirlik airbase in Turkey .
With the threat that the US House of Representatives will approve a resolution that accuses Turks of genocide against ethic Armenians nine decades ago , this is a particularly inopportune moment for the two countries to be at odds over Iraq .
But , worst ##AT##-##AT## case scenarios aside , a Turkish invasion of northern Iraq can only serve the interests of Turkey ’ s Kurdish separatists .
That ’ s why cooler heads are likely to prevail .
Limited cross ##AT##-##AT## border operations are increasingly likely . A war between Turkey and Iraqi Kurds is not .
As an Australian citizen , I voted in the recent federal election there .
So did about 95 % of registered Australian voters .
That figure contrasts markedly with elections in the United States , where the turnout in the 2004 presidential election barely exceeded 60 % .
In Congressional elections that fall in the middle of a president ’ s term , usually fewer than 40 % of eligible Americans bother to vote .
There is a reason why so many Australians vote .
In the 1920 ’ s , when voter turnout fell below 60 % , parliament made voting compulsory .
Since then , despite governments of varying political complexions , there has been no serious attempt to repeal the law , which polls show is supported by about 70 % of the population .
Australians who don ’ t vote receive a letter asking why .
Those without an acceptable excuse , like illness or travel abroad , must pay a small fine , but the number fined is less than 1 % of eligible voters .
In practice , what is compulsory is not casting a valid vote , but going to the polling place , having one ’ s name checked off , and putting a ballot paper in the box .
The secrecy of the ballot makes it impossible to prevent people writing nonsense on their ballot papers or leaving them blank .
While the percentage of invalid votes is a little higher where voting is compulsory , it comes nowhere near offsetting the difference in voter turnout .
Compulsory voting is not unique to Australia .
Belgium and Argentina introduced it earlier , and it is practiced in many other countries , especially in Latin America , although both sanctions and enforcement vary .
Because I was in the US at the time of the Australian election , I was under no compulsion to vote .
I had many reasons to hope for the defeat of John Howard ’ s conservative government , but that doesn ’ t explain why I went to some trouble to vote , since the likelihood that my vote would make any difference was miniscule ( and , predictably , it did not ) .
When voting is voluntary , and the chance that the result will be determined by any single person ’ s vote is extremely low , even the smallest cost – for example , the time it takes to stroll down to the polling place , wait in line , and cast a ballot – is sufficient to make voting seem irrational .
Yet if many people follow this line of reasoning , and do not vote , a minority of the population can determine a country ’ s future , leaving a discontented majority .
Poland ’ s recent electoral history provides an example .
In the 2005 national elections , barely 40 % of those eligible voted , the lowest total since the advent of free elections after the communist period .
As a result , Jaroslaw Kaczynski was able to become prime minister with the support of a coalition of parties that gained a majority of seats in parliament , despite receiving only six million votes , out of a total of 30 million eligible voters .
When Kaczynski was forced to go to the polls again only two years later , it became evident that many of those who had not voted in 2005 were unhappy with the outcome .
Turnout rose to nearly 54 % , with the increase especially marked among younger and better ##AT##-##AT## educated voters .
Kaczynski ’ s government suffered a heavy defeat .
If we don ’ t want a small minority to determine our government , we will favor a high turnout .
Yet since our own vote makes such a tiny contribution to the outcome , each of us still faces the temptation to get a free ride , not bothering to vote while hoping that enough other people will vote to keep democracy robust and to elect a government that is responsive to the views of a majority of citizens .
But there are many possible reasons for voting .
Some people vote because they enjoy it , and would have nothing better to do with the time saved if they did not .
Others are motivated by a sense of civic duty that does not assess the rationality of voting in terms of the possible impact of one ’ s own ballot .
Still others might vote not because they imagine that they will determine the outcome of the election , but because , like football fans , they want to cheer their team on .
They may vote because if they don ’ t , they will be in no position to complain if they don ’ t like the government that is elected .
Or they may calculate that while the chances of their determining the outcome are only one in several million , the result is of such importance that even that tiny chance is enough to outweigh the minor inconveniences of voting .
If these considerations fail to get people to the polls , however , compulsory voting is one way of overcoming the free ##AT##-##AT## rider problem .
The small cost imposed on not voting makes it rational for everyone to vote and at the same time establishes a social norm of voting .
Australians want to be coerced into voting .
They are happy to vote , knowing that everyone else is voting , too .
Countries worried about low voter turnout would do well to consider their compulsory model .
PARIS – Despite the global economic crisis , sales of luxury goods are surging worldwide .
Why ?
While marketing has contributed to the rise , the luxury market ’ s robust growth is actually rooted in biology .
Discussions about the structure of human thought have long been dominated by the Enlightenment view that reality is composed of four elements : space , time , matter , and energy .
But recently , a fifth element , information , has entered the debate .
And information , it turns out , is crucial to understanding the fundamental drivers of luxury ##AT##-##AT## goods consumption , and thus to predicting the luxury market ’ s future .
Living organisms communicate , and the information that they exchange shapes their reality .
While animals use colorful displays and complicated behaviors to signal fitness and strength , humans use luxury goods to demonstrate economic health .
But , more than a symbol , buying luxury goods could indicate future success , owing to the selective advantage that showing off provides .
In nature , competitors perform , and the most compelling , beautiful spectacle wins .
For most animals , males are the performers .
Male birds , for example , often have brightly colored plumage or intricate appendages , such as the Australian lyrebird ’ s long tail .
As a result , competitive displays have been interpreted as a way to demonstrate fitness to a potential mate .
A bird that survives , despite inconvenient plumage that slows it down or makes it visible to predators , must be fit , and will likely sire a healthy progeny .
Given that females bear the physical burden of offspring , an unobtrusive appearance is more advantageous – and thus more common – in nature .
But humans are social creatures with no natural predators , so female competition is more widespread – and demonstrative performance and display are more likely .
Indeed , while visual manifestations of wealth are prevalent for both genders , women ’ s appearance is frequently more vivid ( and more closely scrutinized ) .
But effective display is costly .
Developing complex , vibrant plumage demands significant energy and genetic resources .
Genes are difficult to maintain , requiring subtle and energy ##AT##-##AT## intensive correcting processes .
Just as writing too fast can cause typographical errors that garble a text , rapid changes to the genome can undermine a species ’ integrity .
Likewise , purchasing luxury goods requires substantial financial resources .
This cost dictates the display ’ s competitive impact .
In today ’ s information ##AT##-##AT## based world , selection is effective only if a striking appearance is obtained at a very high price – and that price is known .
For example , those who use cosmetics known to be expensive often seem healthier , more vibrant , and more attractive than those who do not .
This is not the result of efficiency ( the most effective cosmetics frequently become pharmaceutical drugs ) .
Rather , it signals a lifestyle that values the preservation of beauty and youth .
Cosmetics , like all luxury products , gain influence not from their production , or even their purchase , but from their visibility .
Indeed , an expensive item with no label or identifying characteristics has less competitive impact than a recognized item or brand .
For luxury goods to have any function , society needs information about their cost .
This has been true to varying degrees throughout history – sometimes resulting in price bubbles .
False information , such as counterfeit goods , jeopardizes the competition ##AT##-##AT## based selection process .
Animals commonly use mimicry to capitalize on knowledge – or fear – of another ’ s strength .
By imitating an animal with a well ##AT##-##AT## known protective profile , a weaker one may enjoy selective benefits without the costs .
But mimicry ’ s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz .
If there are too few of the original , the profile loses its significance , and its protective value vanishes .
Similarly , nobody would display a symbol of wealth if it were too common .
Therefore , assessing whether luxury goods will maintain their impact , and thus their appeal , requires monitoring the extent of counterfeiting .
Given that luxury goods provide individuals with a competitive advantage , higher luxury ##AT##-##AT## goods sales could indicate a brighter economic future for a country .
In a time of crisis , countries in which luxury goods play their selective role effectively are the safest bets for productive investment .
At the end of this month , James Wolfensohn ’ s ten ##AT##-##AT## year tenure as President of the World Bank comes to an end .
Though much remains to be accomplished and consolidated , his achievements as leader of the international development community are noteworthy and provide a strong foundation upon which to build .
Perhaps Wolfensohn ’ s most important contribution was to clarify the Bank ’ s mission – to promote growth and eradicate poverty in the developing world – while recognizing the massive scale of that task and the inadequacy of previous approaches .
At one time , it was thought that since developing countries had less capital than more developed countries , merely supplying more capital would solve their problems .
Indeed , this view provided part of the rationale for the World Bank : if a shortage of funds was the problem , clearly a Bank would have to be a key part of the solution .
In the 1980 ’ s , there was a switch from projects to policies – structural adjustments , involving trade liberalization , privatization , and macroeconomic stabilization ( typically focusing on prices rather than employment or output . )
But these policies proved neither necessary nor sufficient for growth ; the countries of East Asia , which followed different policies , achieved faster growth and were far more successful in poverty reduction .
Under Wolfensohn ’ s leadership , the Bank began to look for multifaceted strategies , framed by what he called a Comprehensive Development Framework .
Many of the links were obvious , but had been given insufficient attention .
Improved rural productivity or better market access would do little good if roads and harbors were lacking .
In a malaria ##AT##-##AT## infested country , mosquito eradication programs can boost production and even increase effective land usage , as acres that were almost uninhabitable become livable .
The returns from education , too , can be increased , if more individuals live longer because of better health care .
The Bank began to recognize that developing countries differed from more developed countries not just in their lack of resources ; there was also a knowledge gap .
This was particularly important as the world moved into what we call the “ knowledge economy . ”
Among the success stories were India and East Asia , which invested heavily not just in primary education , but also in secondary and tertiary education , and especially in technology and science .
This represented a major change in the Bank ’ s approach to education , which previously focused on primary schooling .
Wolfensohn ’ s campaign against corruption also represented a major change in thinking , a shift from downsizing the state to improving the State .
Failed states , it was now acknowledged , were no less an impediment to development than were overbearing states .
The Bank ’ s 1997 World Development Report reflected this new attempt at finding a balanced role for the state , and showed an understanding of the limitations both of markets and government .
Under Wolfensohn , the Bank repeatedly stood up to the United States , where both the Clinton and Bush administrations might have preferred a more pliant President .
When then US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers tried to change the Bank ’ s Decennial report on poverty – to downgrade concerns about insecurity and empowerment and to focus more narrowly on income – the Bank prevailed .
When the US tried to suppress the Bank ’ s call for a more balanced intellectual property regime – one more consonant with the interests of developing countries – the Bank prevailed yet again .
Both the Bush administration and the EU would undoubtedly have preferred less criticism of their trade regimes , which have such adverse effects on developing countries .
It would have been helpful for Bush if the World Bank quietly accepted proposals to finance debt relief for the poorest countries by depleting its reserves , thereby making poor countries pay for the poorest by reducing the Bank ’ s lending capacity .
But it would have been wrong , and the Bank again stood up for the interests of the developing world .
Changing the relationship between the Bank and the countries seeking its help was no less of an achievement .
In the past , the Bank was seen as a purveyor of neoliberal orthodoxy – an approach to development whose credibility had weakened by the time Wolfensohn arrived , and whose standing has eroded further since .
That orthodoxy often went hand in hand with the national , corporate , and financial interests of the advanced industrial countries , or so it was perceived .
Worse , the Bank typically demanded myriad conditions in return for assistance , an approach that undermined democratic processes and domestic ownership of policies , thereby enervating their effectiveness .
When Bank research showed that conditionality did not work , the Bank under Wolfensohn moved away from it .
The Bank began to realize that on many key issues there were legitimate disagreements among economists about the right course of action .
Democracy requires active debate about economic policies , not the suppression of discussion or the delegation of decision ##AT##-##AT## making to experts , whether domestic or foreign .
The Bank ’ s attempt to open the debate was not well received , by either the US Treasury or the IMF , but its influence was undeniable .
The Fund , too , began to reduce conditionality , and eventually it began to question the desirability of capital market liberalization , which previously had been central to its agenda .
Gradually the Bank came to be perceived , at least in many quarters , as a partner in the joint quest for growth and poverty reduction , not an adversary attempting to promote a Western economic agenda or ideology .
Wolfensohn meant it when he said that he wanted to put the country in the driver ’ s seat , though not everyone within the Bank was as enthusiastic about this ( or some of his other ) initiatives .
James Wolfensohn presided over the World Bank at a time of enormous change , tumult , and opportunity , an era marked by the end of the Cold War , the postcommunist transition to market economies , and the East Asian – and then global – financial crises .
His commitment to those in the developing world has been contagious .
He has left an impressive legacy for his successor to take up .
NEW YORK – We are just recovering , in the United States , from the entirely predictable kerfuffle over a plaint published by Anne ##AT##-##AT## Marie Slaughter , former Director of Policy Planning at the State Department and a professor at Princeton University , called “ Why Women Still Can ’ t Have it All . ”
The response was predictable because Slaughter ’ s article is one that is published in the US by a revolving cast of powerful ( most often white ) women every three years or so .
The article , whoever has written it , always bemoans the “ myth ” of a work ##AT##-##AT## life balance for women who work outside the home , presents the glass ceiling and work ##AT##-##AT## family exhaustion as a personal revelation , and blames “ feminism ” for holding out this elusive “ having ##AT##-##AT## it ##AT##-##AT## all ideal . ”
And it always manages to evade the major policy elephants in the room – which is especially ironic in this case , as Slaughter was worn out by crafting policy .
The problems with such arguments are many .
For starters , the work ##AT##-##AT## family balance is no longer a women ’ s issue .
All over the developed world , millions of working men with small children also regret the hours that they spend away from them , and go home to bear the brunt of shared domestic tasks .
This was a “ women ’ s issue ” 15 years ago , perhaps , but now it is an ambient tension of modern life for a generation of women and men who are committed to gender equality .
Such arguments also ignore the fact that affluent working women and their partners overwhelmingly offload the work ##AT##-##AT## family imbalance onto lower ##AT##-##AT## income women – overwhelmingly women of color .
One can address how to be an ethical , sustainable employer of such caregivers ; nannies in New York and other cities are now organizing to secure a system of market ##AT##-##AT## pegged wages , vacation time , and sick days .
Or , as so often happens in a racist society , one can paint the women who care for the elite ’ s children out of the picture altogether .
Moreover , an inflexible and family ##AT##-##AT## unfriendly corporate environment is no longer the only choice for working women .
Many , particularly in the US , have left that world to start their own businesses .
Most importantly , Americans have a remarkable tendency to reduce problems that others addressed through public policy to a matter of private “ choice ” and even personal psychology .
But the real question is not whether “ women can have it all . ”
Rather , it is how a sophisticated foreign ##AT##-##AT## policy professional can write as if countries like Canada and the Netherlands simply did not exist .
In Canada , couples with a baby may sequence six ##AT##-##AT## month leaves of absence at up to 90 % pay .
In the Netherlands – the best scenario I have seen yet – families can take a day off each week , and the government subsidizes full ##AT##-##AT## time daycare .
This solution was not framed as a “ women ’ s issue , ” but as a family benefit .
And Dutch women have simply moved on , focusing on other interesting goals in their personal and family lives .
In America , by contrast , the Chamber of Commerce and other business interests lobby hard to keep politicians from ever proposing such solutions .
They know that billions of dollars are made from hiring women at lower income levels than men , and then ensuring that a work ##AT##-##AT## family conflict derails women ’ s careers before they become too expensive to compensate fairly .
Of course , Europe is not gender ##AT##-##AT## equality Nirvana .
In particular , the corporate workplace will never be completely family ##AT##-##AT## friendly until women are part of senior management decisions , and Europe ’ s top corporate ##AT##-##AT## governance positions remain overwhelmingly male .
Indeed , women hold only 14 % of positions on European corporate boards .
The European Union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women – up to 60 % .
This proposed mandate was born of frustration .
Last year , European Commission Vice President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action .
Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goals of 40 % female board membership .
The Forte foundation in America has now followed suit with its own list of “ board ##AT##-##AT## ready women . ”
But Reding ’ s appeal in Europe was considered a failure : only 24 companies took it up .
Do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate ladder fairly as they balance work and family ?
“ Personally , I don ’ t like quotas , ” Reding said recently .
“ But I like what the quotas do . ”
Quotas get action : they “ open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling , ” according to Reding , a result seen in France and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women in top business positions .
I understand Reding ’ s reticence – and her frustration .
I don ’ t like quotas either ; they run counter to my belief in meritocracy .
But , when one considers the obstacles to achieving the meritocratic ideal , it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily mandated .
After all , four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as well as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions – no matter how much “ soft pressure ” is put upon them .
When women do break through to the summit of corporate power – as , for example , Sheryl Sandberg recently did at Facebook – they garner massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule .
If appropriate public policies were in place to help all women – whether CEOs or their children ’ s caregivers – and all families , Sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person living in a more just society .
And laments like Slaughter ’ s would not be necessary .
SINGAPORE – The latest information dump from WikiLeaks offers fascinating insights into the workings of the US State Department that will keep foreign policy wonks and conspiracy theorists busy for months .
Much of what has been reported is not “ news ” in the traditional sense , of course , but a series of embarrassing gaffes : truths that were never meant to be said aloud .
Underlying these various , and often banal , tidbits of information – it should be no surprise that Americans found Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi “ vain , ” or regarded Zimbabwe ’ s Robert Mugabe as a “ crazy old man ” – is the larger question of whether governments should be able to keep secrets .
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange argues that the answer is no , and that greater transparency “ creates a better society for all people . ”
This raises the question of why governments keep secrets at all , and whether those reasons are justified .
The task of keeping a state ’ s secrets frequently falls to its intelligence services , which tend to focus on the protection of three types of information .
The first type is their own sources and methods , which need to be safeguarded if they are to remain effective when gathering data .
When the Washington Times reported in 1998 that the National Security Agency was able to monitor Osama bin Laden ’ s satellite phone , for example , he stopped using it .
Second , the identities and activities of a service ’ s operational staff should be withheld , so that they can do their jobs and to ensure their safety .
Following WikiLeaks ’ release in July of tens of thousands of documents on the Afghan war , a Taliban spokesman told British journalists that the group was “ studying the report ” with a view to identifying and punishing anyone found to have collaborated with US forces .
Third , information provided in confidence by foreign governments or intelligence services must be closely held to avoid embarrassing the provider of the information and thereby reducing the likelihood that information will be shared in future .
A lasting consequence of the most recent leak is circumspection when sharing intelligence with the United States .
In reality , of course , governments typically attempt to keep much more than this secret .
Avoiding embarrassment may at times be in the national interest , but it can also protect the careers of politicians and bureaucrats . In other circumstances , it may be prudent to avoid revealing how much – or how little – is known about a given situation .
WikiLeaks sees itself as part of the tradition in which the media hold governments accountable for abuse .
The role of the Fourth Estate was particularly important during the administration of President George W Bush .
Revelations of torture , extraordinary rendition , and warrantless electronic surveillance all depended on investigative journalism of a kind that is now threatened by budget cuts and the media ’ s relentless focus on whatever is current – often at the expense of what is genuinely newsworthy .
But , whereas true investigative journalism depends on quality , WikiLeaks distinguishes itself by quantity .
The sheer volume of the data being dumped on the Internet makes it impossible for thorough analysis or , indeed , for thorough examination of potentially damaging information .
The threshold for exposure is no longer wrongdoing of the scale that coined the term “ Watergate ” and all the subsequent “ -gates . ”
Instead , government officials are being warned that every document may potentially be leaked and published worldwide by a disgruntled junior officer .
The consequence is unlikely to be transparency .
Perversely , it will lead to greater secrecy .
The message that is almost certainly going through every major power is : be careful what you commit to writing .
In place of candid assessments and provocative analysis , many important decisions will now be based on oral briefings and meetings that are not recorded in minutes .
Decision ##AT##-##AT## makers will be wary of openness even with their closest staff .
These changes are likely to outlast US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s embarrassment .
Such self ##AT##-##AT## censorship will lead to worse decisions and less accountability for the decisions that are made .
It seems a high price to pay for gossip .
PARIS – Beyond the headlines , the embarrassment of governments , and the blow dealt to the secrecy of diplomatic correspondence , WikiLeaks ’ exposure of US diplomatic cables offers a raw illustration of how deeply the essence of power has been altered in our information age .
Since its inception , the state has been the main vessel of power ; access to power usually meant control of the state , whether by election or by violent takeover .
This model , within which individuals are subjects or , at best , taxpayers and voters , is being undermined by several recent trends that have empowered the individual .
Consider the Internet , a network of connected nodes invented in the 1960 ’ s , at the height of the Cold War , to preserve the United States from total chaos after a nuclear attack on its nerve centers .
It was deliberately constructed with no hierarchy , no core , and no central authority , though few at the time could have suspected where , given the numerous breakthroughs of the digital revolution , the Internet ’ s built ##AT##-##AT## in trend toward decentralized power would lead .
It has led to the second trend : a metamorphosis of the production process .
Information has become much more than a message conveyed by technology ; it is now the raw material of services ##AT##-##AT## intensive advanced economies , and the building block of modern social and productive organizations .
The third trend concerns the room this has opened for individual and collective action .
In The Human Condition , the philosopher Hannah Arendt linked politics to the human capacity not simply to act , but to “ act in concert . ”
While concerted action is a familiar notion , it used to be aimed mainly at influencing the state – exemplified by the way civil society prompted America ’ s withdrawal from Vietnam .
Today , however , collective action is of a different magnitude .
Because of the universality of the digital language , its ease of use , and the virtual absence of marginal costs for producing or disseminating information , the state ’ s tools of control have been weakened and depleted .
Global finance has been one of the most eager beneficiaries of these trends , using Internet networks not just as a tool to conduct operations with greater efficiency and velocity , but also as a means to circumvent state supervision .
Corporations have dwelled on connectivity to globalize their markets , R &amp; amp ; D , ownership , tax domiciliation , and leadership , thoroughly transforming their relationship with states , whether in their country of origin or elsewhere .
In September 1992 , it took George Soros $ 10 billion to bring the Bank of England to its knees and impose devaluation on the pound .
It now takes only a computer and Internet connection to cause serious trouble : intrusion by hackers into protected networks , or the introduction of havoc ##AT##-##AT## wreaking software viruses and worms in sensitive information systems .
While the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 – the deadliest of all time – had nothing “ virtual ” about them , their perpetrator , al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda , projects a cloud of threat and power by using cyberspace to promote its bloody “ successes , ” spread hatred , and recruit jihadists .
Of course , access to a networked world has also balanced state power in positive ways , by giving a formidable boost to independent advocacy , as seen in the online campaign to ban landmines and the treaty that ratified its success – despite opposition by powerful states .
Many similar organizations have flourished , gaining the ability to shape political outcomes and public policies .
But there is no place where the transformative power of connectivity is potentially greater than in China , with its reported 420 million Internet users .
No matter how eager China ’ s authorities are to keep the Internet under their control – for example , by blocking foreign Web sites – they are also aware of how much their economy now needs the Internet .
As a result , the room for “ concerted action ” has never been so large for individual Chinese to gain access to uncensored information , share opinions , and communicate country ##AT##-##AT## wide to expose official misconduct .
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for circulating on the Internet his proposal for a truly democratic constitution , Charter 08 , which gathered 10,000 signatures online in only 24 hours .
In the late 1980 ’ s , glasnost – transparency – was one of the nails in the coffin of the Soviet Union .
While WikiLeaks has certainly not had a similar effect , it epitomizes the extent of the individual ’ s empowerment in a networked world .
All that was necessary to challenge the world ’ s mightiest power , after all , was a disgruntled US Army intelligence analyst , some hacking knowledge , a few computers , and a handful of determined activists enrolled under the contested banner of transparency .
At the time she was named Director of Policy Planning at the US State Department , Anne ##AT##-##AT## Marie Slaughter , a respected scholar of international affairs , boldly heralded the advent of a networked world . “ War , diplomacy , business , media , society … are networked , ” she wrote in Foreign Affairs in January 2009 , and “ in this world , the measure of power is connectedness . ”
This drive prompted US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in January 2010 to proclaim the “ freedom to connect ” as the cyber ##AT##-##AT## equivalent of the more familiar freedoms of assembly or expression .
Of course , Clinton added , these technologies are not an unmitigated blessing , and can be misused for darker purposes .
But her list of the potential abuses of the connected world contained nothing similar to the WikiLeaks storm .
That storm will leave behind no trace of understanding if it is assessed in isolation , rather than as part of a broader pattern .
WikiLeaks ’ latest release demonstrates that the transformation of power by the “ digital revolution ” could be as far ##AT##-##AT## reaching as that brought about by the fifteenth ##AT##-##AT## century printing revolution .
In this game , where new players invite themselves , the edge goes to agility and innovation .
All of this implies that connectedness will remain a double ##AT##-##AT## edged sword – the leverage it provides being fraught with vulnerability .
And that means that we can count on more surprises in store for states .
Most people do not feel the same impulse to go out and buy insurance , or diversify their investments , as they do to buy a sofa or new clothes .
They should , but they don &apos;t .
Insurance , investment , and banking institutions have historically had to fight an uphill battle to get individuals , businesses , and government to pay for risk management .
Their successes , while impressive , remain incomplete : people still have difficulty facing the inherent risks and uncertainties about their economic future .
This is why almost every advanced country has mandatory social security and health insurance programs .
Of course , people are not really unaware of life &apos;s big risks .
We simply ignore them for reasons that are rooted in human psychology .
The link between intellectual recognition of risks and the impetus to act against them is mediated by fear : we have been programmed over millions of years of evolution to take decisive action against immediate and obvious threats .
If a menacing wild animal approaches , we feel fear and anxiety .
Adrenaline flows , our attention is focussed , and our instinct to protect friends and family aroused .
But more remote risks simply do not stimulate our emotions , so we often postpone taking action indefinitely .
We are also more afraid of well ##AT##-##AT## publicized risks - especially those that can kill us in grisly ways .
After the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the US , many Americans drove to distant locations rather than fly , even though statistics showed that flying remained far safer .
Meanwhile , many of these same people were probably among the millions of Americans who didn &apos;t get an annual medical check ##AT##-##AT## up .
Measuring risks , especially important long ##AT##-##AT## term ones , is imprecise and difficult .
Virtually none of the economic statistics reported in the media measure risk .
To fully comprehend risk , we must stretch our imagination to think of all the different ways that things can go wrong , including things that have not happened in recent memory .
We must protect ourselves against fallacies , such as thinking that just because a risk has not proved damaging for decades , it no longer exists .
Yet another psychological barrier is a sort of ego involvement in our own success .
Our tendency to take full credit for our successes discourages us from facing up to the possibility of loss or failure , because considering such prospects calls into question our self ##AT##-##AT## satisfaction .
Indeed , self ##AT##-##AT## esteem is one of the most powerful human needs : a view of our own success relative to others provides us with a sense of meaning and well ##AT##-##AT## being .
So accepting the essential randomness of life is terribly difficult , and contradicts our deep psychological need for order and accountability .
We often do not protect the things that we have - such as our opportunities to earn income and accumulate wealth - because we mistakenly believe that our own natural superiority will do that for us .
This tendency is especially apparent when it comes to public policy .
Government leaders find it hard to address economic risks to the nation because it is impolitic to call into question the self ##AT##-##AT## esteem of their constituency .
But no one who looks at the matter seriously can argue that the tremendous inequality between the world &apos;s nations reflects fundamental differences in inherent ability or immutable character .
The per capita GDP of India in 2000 , for example , was only 7 % of that of the US .
Can anyone believe that this is because Americans are 14 times smarter or 14 times better in character than Indians ?
Obviously , these two countries &apos; relative positions are due to circumstances that can be changed , or that will change in response to economic events and political decisions .
But the leaders of the world &apos;s rich countries have great difficulty addressing risks to their relative success vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis less developed countries , because national self ##AT##-##AT## esteem is too tied up with it .
Citizens in advanced countries just can &apos;t believe - and don &apos;t want to be told - that their privileged status may be dissipated unless proper steps are taken to insure against the risks they face .
For example , the world &apos;s advanced countries are scarcely less dependent on oil today than they were in 1973 , when the OPEC embargo stifled their economies and sent prices soaring .
Despite occasional efforts at conservation , rich countries always go back to &quot; business as usual . &quot;
Most companies are no better at managing or even recognizing the different kinds of economic risks that their workers face .
Many maintain insurance and pensions for their employees , but also encourage their workers to trust the company to provide for them forever , and even to invest in the company &apos;s stock .
When an employee is laid off in middle age , or the company goes bankrupt , the suddenly materialized risk may come as a shock .
Clearly , establishing mandatory social security and health insurance programs , and a social safety net for the poor , has helped hedge the most fundamental risks that people face .
The problem is the lack of any coherent policy for ensuring that individuals are protected against a broader array of economic risks to their incomes , investments , and homes .
So new risk management institutions need to be devised .
They should use markets , rather than state guarantees , and while they should not be mandatory , they must be designed in accordance with humans &apos; psychological limitations , so that people will use them .
We know enough about risk perception to recognize that helping people cope with the risks of modern life requires addressing their hearts as well as their heads .
NEW YORK – In their efforts to pass a bailout plan for America ’ s financial system , Bush administration officials invoked the specter of the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s .
But , for most Asians , economic Armageddon is far more recent .
The Asian financial crisis of a decade ago brought banks , corporations and governments to their knees .
The bonfire was sparked by the collapse of the Thai baht in the summer of 1997 .
Contagion soon spread across East Asia , with the ripple effects of serial currency devaluations reaching as far as Russia and Brazil .
The long ##AT##-##AT## running “ economic miracles ” of South Korea and Hong Kong ended , as did surging growth in Indonesia and Thailand .
The central lesson taken from that crisis was to maintain large foreign ##AT##-##AT## exchange reserves .
This became a virtual article of faith among East Asian governments .
Back in the 1990 ’ s , Asia ’ s fast ##AT##-##AT## growing economies maintained small reserves , despite booming exports and foreign investment .
Once the tailspin began in 1997 , governments ’ lack of reserves hampered their ability to rescue failed banks , forcing them to appeal to international institutions for relief .
But the International Monetary Fund ’ s bailout came with strings attached , including demands for more of the rapid capital market liberalization that induced the crisis in the first place .
Indeed , what the West calls the “ Asian financial crisis ” is known in Asia as the “ IMF crisis . ”
The political humiliation and economic frustration of dealing with IMF imperatives confirmed the central importance of maintaining large reserves , as an issue not just of currency stability , but also economic sovereignty .
One Asian economy emerged from the 1997 ##AT##-##AT## 1998 crisis relatively unscathed : China .
There were many reasons for this , but foremost among them was that China had already amassed more than $ 100 billion in reserves , and refused to revalue its currency , when the crisis hit .
Since then , China has aggressively pursued a fast ##AT##-##AT## growth , export , and investment heavy model of economic development .
By capping the exchange rate and producing far more than it consumes , China ’ s reserves grew into a Leviathan , hitting the $ 1 trillion mark in 2005 .
Even after China ( under pressure from US Treasury officials ) let the yuan partially float in 2005 , the Leviathan kept growing by about $ 200 billion annually .
Over the past year and a half , China ’ s reserves skyrocketed to $ 1.8 trillion , far and away the world ’ s largest .
The Chinese state probably hasn ’ t sat on so much lucre since the halcyon days of the Qing Empire , when insatiable European demand for porcelain , tea and silk flooded the central coffers in Beijing with silver bullion .
But the paradox is that today ’ s reserves are not real wealth that can be pumped back into the domestic economy .
Instead , China ’ s reserves mostly underwrite America ’ s debt .
Even before Wall Street hit the skids , there was growing consensus in China that its reserves had grown far beyond what was necessary to avert another 1997 ##AT##-##AT## style crisis .
Calls for a more diversified investment strategy intensified .
Investing in US Treasuries , after all , was a sure loss ##AT##-##AT## maker , given the gap between their modest yield and the steady appreciation of the yuan .
With the creation one year ago of a $ 200 billion sovereign wealth fund , the China Investment Corporation , Beijing positioned itself for more equity investment ( although its early investments , in the Blackstone Group and Morgan Stanley , were widely criticized ) .
Economist Andy Xie , formerly with Morgan Stanley , proposed last week that China trade its dollar assets for shares in US companies on a grand scale , challenging America to overcome its financial xenophobia in order to avert a disaster of undercapitalization .
But many in China , from nationalist bloggers to social justice activists , advance a deeper critique of the Leviathan reserve .
Why bind up Chinese capital to finance America ’ s debt ##AT##-##AT## consumption economy , they ask , when so many needs go unmet at home ?
China was one of the world ’ s most egalitarian societies as late as 1985 .
Today , it suffers one of the world ’ s biggest gaps between haves and have ##AT##-##AT## nots .
Chinese ##AT##-##AT## style capitalism is flaunting its defiance of one Confucius ’ basic teachings — don ’ t worry about poverty , he warned , worry about inequality .
China ’ s physical infrastructure in booming central cities is undergoing radical modernization , but the social and environmental infrastructure is falling apart , especially in the interior and for the huge rural population .
For years , the central government has talked about creating “ social harmony ” — with a “ new ##AT##-##AT## type rural cooperative medical services system , ” by increasing spending on education to 4 % of GDP and eliminating school fees , and implementing “ sustainable development ” models .
The promises are grand , but the actions have not measured up .
And the economic costs of restricted access to healthcare and education , on top of the scarcity of clear air and potable water , will be crippling in the mid- and long ##AT##-##AT## term .
The challenge for China in the years to come is to divest itself of American debt , and begin investing in the health , education and environmental well ##AT##-##AT## being of its own people .
Growing the economy at an average annual rate of 10 % , it turns out , may have been the easy part .
NEW YORK – Global financial markets in 2008 experienced their worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s .
Major financial institutions went bust ; others were bought up on the cheap or survived only after major bailouts .
Global stock markets fell by more than 50 % ; interest ##AT##-##AT## rate spreads skyrocketed ; a severe liquidity and credit crunch appeared ; and many emerging ##AT##-##AT## market economies staggered to the International Monetary Fund for help .
So what lies ahead in 2009 ?
Is the worst behind us or ahead of us ?
To answer these questions , we must understand that a vicious circle of economic contraction and worsening financial conditions is underway .
The United States will certainly experience its worst recession in decades , a deep and protracted contraction lasting about 24 months through the end of 2009 .
Moreover , the entire global economy will contract .
There will be recession in the euro zone , the United Kingdom , Continental Europe , Canada , Japan , and the other advanced economies .
There is also a risk of a hard landing for emerging ##AT##-##AT## market economies , as trade , financial , and currency links transmit real and financial shocks to them .
In the advanced economies , recession had brought back earlier in 2008 fears of 1970 ’ s ##AT##-##AT## style stagflation ( a combination of economic stagnation and inflation ) .
But , with aggregate demand falling below growing aggregate supply , slack goods markets will lead to lower inflation as firms ’ pricing power is restrained .
Likewise , rising unemployment will control labor costs and wage growth .
These factors , combined with sharply falling commodity prices , will cause inflation in advanced economies to ease toward the 1 % level , raising concerns about deflation , not stagflation .
Deflation is dangerous as it leads to a liquidity trap : nominal policy rates cannot fall below zero , so monetary policy becomes ineffective .
Falling prices mean that the real cost of capital is high and the real value of nominal debts rise , leading to further declines in consumption and investment – and thus setting in motion a vicious circle in which incomes and jobs are squeezed further , aggravating the fall in demand and prices .
As traditional monetary policy becomes ineffective , other unorthodox policies will continue to be used : policies to bail out investors , financial institutions , and borrowers ; massive provision of liquidity to banks in order to ease the credit crunch ; and even more radical actions to reduce long ##AT##-##AT## term interest rates on government bonds and narrow the spread between market rates and government bonds .
Today ’ s global crisis was triggered by the collapse of the US housing bubble , but it was not caused by it .
America ’ s credit excesses were in residential mortgages , commercial mortgages , credit cards , auto loans , and student loans .
There was also excess in the securitized products that converted these debts into toxic financial derivatives ; in borrowing by local governments ; in financing for leveraged buyouts that should never have occurred ; in corporate bonds that will now suffer massive losses in a surge of defaults ; in the dangerous and unregulated credit default swap market .
Moreover , these pathologies were not confined to the US .
There were housing bubbles in many other countries , fueled by excessive cheap lending that did not reflect underlying risks .
There was also a commodity bubble and a private equity and hedge funds bubble .
Indeed , we now see the demise of the shadow banking system , the complex of non ##AT##-##AT## bank financial institutions that looked like banks as they borrowed short term and in liquid ways , leveraged a lot , and invested in longer term and illiquid ways .
As a result , the biggest asset and credit bubble in human history is now going bust , with overall credit losses likely to be close to a staggering $ 2 trillion .
Thus , unless governments rapidly recapitalize financial institutions , the credit crunch will become even more severe as losses mount faster than recapitalization and banks are forced to contract credit and lending .
Equity prices and other risky assets have fallen sharply from their peaks of late 2007 , but there are still significant downside risks .
An emerging consensus suggests that the prices of many risky assets – including equities – have fallen so much that we are at the bottom and a rapid recovery will occur .
But the worst is still ahead of us .
In the next few months , the macroeconomic news and earnings / profits reports from around the world will be much worse than expected , putting further downward pressure on prices of risky assets , because equity analysts are still deluding themselves that the economic contraction will be mild and short .
While the risk of a total systemic financial meltdown has been reduced by the actions of the G ##AT##-##AT## 7 and other economies to backstop their financial systems , severe vulnerabilities remain .
The credit crunch will get worse ; deleveraging will continue , as hedge funds and other leveraged players are forced to sell assets into illiquid and distressed markets , thus causing more price falls and driving more insolvent financial institutions out of business .
A few emerging ##AT##-##AT## market economies will certainly enter a full ##AT##-##AT## blown financial crisis .
So 2009 will be a painful year of global recession and further financial stresses , losses , and bankruptcies .
Only aggressive , coordinated , and effective policy actions by advanced and emerging ##AT##-##AT## market countries can ensure that the global economy recovers in 2010 , rather than entering a more protracted period of economic stagnation .
LONDON – Silvio Berlusconi , Italy ’ s three ##AT##-##AT## time prime minister and the country ’ s dominant politician for two decades , has now been convicted and sentenced to four years in prison – a sentence since reduced to one year . &amp; nbsp ; But few people in Italy – or in Europe – believe that Berlusconi will fade from Italian , or European , politics anytime soon .
Just a few days ago , he declared his intention to remain involved in politics , though not to run for prime minister a fourth time .
Whatever role Berlusconi chooses to play , it is unlikely to be a marginal one .
He may not wish to be king again , but he certainly can be a kingmaker , owing to his control of Mediaset , Italy ’ s largest media group .
And , given his abysmal popularity ratings , he may decide to play the wild card , embrace a euro ##AT##-##AT## skeptic and anti ##AT##-##AT## government stance , and try to bring down Prime Minister Mario Monti ’ s technocratic administration .
Monti ’ s government took over from Berlusconi in November 2011 , arriving with a clear mandate , and full parliamentary support , to implement the measures needed to restore market confidence and reassure Italy ’ s eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund that the country was not going down the path taken by Greece .
At the time of the G ##AT##-##AT## 20 summit in Cannes that month , Italy – and Europe – was dangerously close to collapse , with Berlusconi ’ s government deeply divided about the fiscal measures needed to bring down the country ’ s debt ##AT##-##AT## service costs .
Domestic political deadlock , and Berlusconi ’ s inability to engage with Germany and France resulted in spiraling refinancing costs , with the spread relative to German bunds consistently over 500 basis points between July and November 2011 .
The Monti government has restored market confidence and Italy ’ s international credibility .
But the overall picture remains fragile .
The interest ##AT##-##AT## rate spread has stabilized around a more manageable 300 basis points , but is still higher than it was three years ago .
In addition , Italy ’ s economic outlook remains highly uncertain .
Indeed , the modest economic recovery that should benefit many countries in 2013 seems to be eluding Italy .
According to the IMF , the economy will remain in recession next year , and , though the rate of contraction will be less severe than in 2012 ( -0.7 % in 2013 , compared to -2.3 % this year ) , the unemployment rate is expected to rise further , from 10.6 % to 11.1 % .
More needs to be done in order to support economic growth in the short term , improve the country ’ s fiscal position in the medium term , and implement the structural reforms needed to make the Italian economy more robust and internationally competitive in the long term .
Italy is ranked 43rd in the World Economic Forum ’ s global competitiveness index , well below the main eurozone countries , owing to lack of investment – especially in human capital – and structural rigidities that have constrained growth for many years .
The answer to Italy ’ s economic problems is not , as Berlusconi advocates , an exit from the eurozone and a return to the flexibility of its own currency , which in the past allowed policymakers to boost competitiveness through irresponsible devaluations .
Italy needs to learn how to live with the euro and within the eurozone , which means adopting policies that ensure that productivity growth and innovation , not currency devaluation , are the main drivers of competitiveness .
A stable , competent , and responsible government with a comfortable parliamentary majority is essential to continue what Monti ’ s government has initiated .
While the odds still favor a relatively smooth transition , many uncertainties could derail the reform process .
In particular , whether Italy will be able to move beyond technocratic politics to a “ normal ” government remains the outstanding question both at home and for the other eurozone member states .
From this perspective , what Berlusconi advocates for Italy , and the consequences of his agenda for the eurozone , is not good news .
Any hint that the country may be locked again in parliamentary inertia , as in the final months of Berlusconi ’ s last government , would push the markets to question the credibility of Italy ’ s fiscal ##AT##-##AT## consolidation plan , jeopardizing the country ’ s ability to refinance its debt .
That debt is the largest in the eurozone – at roughly € 2 trillion ( $ 2.6 trillion ) , or 120 % of the country ’ s GDP – which means that Italy can be helped , but not rescued .
With potential instability looming , Monti should ensure that Italy is not defenseless in the event of another round of market instability .
Unlike some months ago , now the European Central Bank can intervene and buy troubled countries ’ debt .
But this mechanism can be activated only by formal request .
Italy should follow this route without delay .
It is better to have a powerful weapon that may gather dust than to be unarmed in a time of need .
From September 10 ##AT##-##AT## 14 , trade ministers from around the world will meet for the next stage of what is supposed to be the Development Round of trade talks .
At their last meeting in Doha in November 2001 , ministers recognized the inequities of the previous round of trade negotiations , the Uruguay round .
This round was supposed to redress those imbalances .
One would have thought that the developing countries would look forward to the meeting as a chance to achieve a fairer global trading system .
Instead , many fear that what has happened in the past will happen again : secret negotiations , arm twisting , and the display of brute economic power by the US and Europe--and by special interests in the advanced countries--aimed at ensuring that the interests of the rich are protected .
While some progress has been made in making the negotiations more open and transparent , efforts to go further have met with resistance , and for good reason : unbalanced processes help ensure unbalanced outcomes .
Ironically , the World Trade Organization , where each country has one vote , might seem far more &quot; democratic &quot; than , say , the IMF , where a single country , the US , has a veto .
Yet the realpolitik of economic power has ensured that the interests of the developed countries predominate .
Here is a short checklist against which to assess whether the outcomes of Cancun represent a move towards a true development round .
· Agriculture . Most people in the developing world live in the rural sector , which is why free and fair trade in agriculture matters .
It &apos;s not just a question of providing access , but of eliminating the subsidies that encourage production in rich countries and harm farmers in poor countries .
The numbers are truly alarming : subsidies in advanced countries exceed the total income of sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan Africa ; the average European subsidy per cow matches the $ 2 per day poverty level on which billions of people barely subsist ; America &apos;s $ 4 billion cotton subsidies to 25,000 well ##AT##-##AT## off farmers bring misery to 10 million African farmers and more than offset America &apos;s miserly foreign aid to some of the affected countries .
Although both Europe and America accuse each other of unfair agricultural policies , neither side seems willing to make major concessions .
· Drugs and intellectual property . TRIPS , the intellectual property regime adopted in the last round of trade negotiations , deprived millions in the developing world of access to life ##AT##-##AT## saving drugs .
As a chorus of researchers has pointed out , the provisions , pushed by the pharmaceutical companies , were so unbalanced that they were bad for scientific progress .
Here , there has been some progress--but not enough .
Provisions demanded by the US would have made it difficult for small countries , like Botswana , to gain affordable access .
Developing countries also continue to worry about bio ##AT##-##AT## piracy--the patenting by Western firms of traditional foods and drugs .
· Textiles . The Uruguay round promised the elimination of quotas in 2004 , enabling many developing countries to exploit another area of comparative advantage .
But many developing countries worry that trade restrictions will remain , whether through &quot; safeguards &quot; to protect jobs or through high tariffs .
Many also fear that the West will find some way to wiggle out of its commitments .
· A more balanced liberalization agenda . With services comprising an increasing share of production in developed countries , attention has shifted to liberalization of trade in services .
A more balanced agenda would balance attempts to ease capital flows with efforts to facilitate the flow of labor , including unskilled labor .
· Competition . Everyone advocates &quot; fair competition . &quot;
But discussions about competition and fair trade again demonstrate the intellectual poverty and inequity of trade negotiations .
Anti ##AT##-##AT## dumping laws are intended to ensure fair trade by preventing the sale of goods below cost .
Within the developed countries , there has long been concern about such behavior--so ##AT##-##AT## called &quot; predation &quot; --and well ##AT##-##AT## defined standards have been developed .
With globalization , it would be natural to extend such principles to the international arena , making it irrelevant whether a producer is domestic or foreign when judging whether he is engaged in an unfair trade practice .
But it does make a difference whether a good is produced at home or abroad .
Foreign producers are accused of &quot; unfair &quot; competition far more easily than domestic producers .
Indeed , if the standards of domestic trade laws were applied internationally , perhaps a majority of firms within the US would be guilty of dumping .
Yet America &apos;s Supreme Court has set standards so high for American firms to be found guilty of predation that few cases are successfully prosecuted domestically .
The trade negotiators are not even discussing eliminating this double standard .
So developing countries worry that efforts to introduce &quot; competition &quot; within trade negotiations will only make life even more difficult .
They worry that efforts to promote domestic industries or provide preferential treatment to disadvantaged groups ( the kind of affirmative action programs that have been so important , both in developed and less developed countries ) will be labeled &quot; unfair &quot; to foreign firms , and thus be prohibited .
There is a real danger that what was intended to remedy the imbalances of previous trade rounds will not only fail to do so , but may introduce new imbalances .
Pushing countries to liberalize their capital markets and open them up to speculative capital flows is one example .
At the very moment when the IMF has finally recognized that such liberalization may produce instability but not growth , the WTO is now pursuing it .
Failure at Cancun would confirm the fears of those who resisted a new round of trade negotiations .
Needless to say , it would also provide support for the anti ##AT##-##AT## globalization protestors everywhere .
CAMBRIDGE ­ – There is a serious danger that the international adoption of cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade legislation to limit carbon ##AT##-##AT## dioxide emissions will trigger a new round of protectionist measures .
While aimed at reducing long ##AT##-##AT## term environmental damage , cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade policies could produce significant harmful economic effects in the near term that would continue into the future .
Scientific evidence appears to indicate that the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels ( primarily coal , oil , and natural gas ) – mainly in electricity production , transportation , and various industrial processes – contributes to gradual global warming , with long ##AT##-##AT## term adverse effects on living conditions around the world .
It is with this in mind that representatives of more than 150 countries are scheduled to meet in Copenhagen in December to discuss ways to reduce CO2 emissions .
A common suggestion is to impose a tax on all CO2 emissions , which would be levied on companies that emit CO2 in production , or that sell products like gasoline that cause CO2 emissions when used .
Such a tax would cause electricity companies and industrial firms to adopt techniques that reduce their CO2 emissions , as long as the cost of doing so is less than the tax that they would otherwise have to pay .
The higher cost of production incurred to reduce emissions – and of any emissions tax still due – would , of course , be included in the price charged to consumers .
Consumers would respond to the tax ##AT##-##AT## induced increase in the cost of the emissions ##AT##-##AT## intensive products by reducing their consumption of those goods and services in favor of goods and services that create smaller amounts of CO2 emissions .
A carbon tax causes each firm and household to respond to the same cost of adding CO2 to the atmosphere .
That uniform individual cost incentive allows total CO2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administrative requirements , such as automobile mileage standards , production technology standards ( e.g. , minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation ) , etc .
Yet we do not see carbon taxes being adopted .
Although governments levy taxes on gasoline , they are reluctant to impose a general carbon tax because of public opposition to any form of taxation .
Governments have therefore focused on a cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade system as a way of increasing the cost of CO2 ##AT##-##AT## intensive products without explicitly imposing a tax .
In a cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade system , the government sets total allowable national emissions of CO2 per year and requires any firm that causes CO2 emissions to have a permit per ton of CO2 emitted .
If the government sells these permits in an auction , the price of the permit would be a cost to the firm in the same way as a carbon tax – and with the same resulting increases in consumer prices .
The cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade system thus imposes a carbon tax without having to admit that it is really a tax .
A cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade system can cause serious risks to international trade .
Even if every country has a cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade system and all aim at the same relative reduction in national CO2 emissions , the resulting permit prices will differ because of national differences in initial CO2 levels and in domestic production characteristics .
Because the price of the CO2 permits in a country is reflected in the prices of its products , the cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade system affects its international competitiveness .
When the permit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions , there will be political pressure to introduce tariffs on imports that offset the advantage of countries with low permit prices .
Such offsetting tariffs would have to differ among products ( being higher on more CO2 ##AT##-##AT## intensive products ) and among countries ( being higher for countries with low permit prices ) .
Such a system of complex differential tariffs is just the kind of protectionism that governments have been working to eliminate since the start of the GATT process more than 50 years ago .
Worse still , cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade systems in practice do not rely solely on auctions to distribute the emissions permits .
The plan working its way through the United States Congress ( the Waxman ##AT##-##AT## Markey bill ) would initially give away 85 % of the permits , impose a complex set of regulatory policies , and allow companies to buy CO2 offsets ( e.g. , by paying for the planting of trees ) instead of reducing their emissions or buying permits .
Such complexities make it impossible to compare the impact of CO2 policies among countries , which in turn would invite those who want to protect domestic jobs to argue for higher tariff levels .
There is no easy answer to this problem .
But before rushing to impose tariffs , it is important to remember that cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade policies would not be the only government source of differences in competitiveness .
Better roads , ports , and even schools all contribute to a country ’ s competitiveness .
No one attempts to use tariffs to balance those government ##AT##-##AT## created differences in competitiveness , and there should be no such attempts if a cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade system is introduced .
If an international agreement to impose a cap ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## trade scheme is adopted in Copenhagen , the countries there should agree as well that there will be no attempt to introduce offsetting tariffs that would ultimately threaten our global system of free trade .
When the International Olympic Committee awarded Beijing the 2008 Summer Games in July 2001 , the announcement ignited wild celebrations across the country .
The Chinese Communist Party hoped to use the Games to showcase the country ’ s emergence as a dynamic , modern nation .
But as China ’ s leaders begin final preparations for the Games next August , they may be wondering if hosting the event was such a good idea after all .
They have significant reasons for doubt .
China ’ s senior leaders always closely monitor spontaneous public expressions of nationalist fervor , fearful that shifting winds might blow an unwelcome storm in their direction .
Of course what they hope is that the Games will channel these energies toward national solidarity , which will allow the leadership to deliver its people a moment of achievement and patriotic glory .
But the Olympics will also bring intense international scrutiny of China ’ s weaknesses at a delicate moment in the country ’ s development .
The world already knows of China ’ s success and its attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment , but few outsiders have seen firsthand the steep price the country is paying for its new prosperity .
The most obvious signs of that cost flow through the country ’ s waterways and contaminate its air .
Runaway growth and development have left about 70 % of China ’ s lakes and rivers severely polluted , many unfit for human use of any kind .
Indeed , nearly a half ##AT##-##AT## billion Chinese lack access to clean drinking water , and the number of terminally polluted rivers and lakes grows daily .
But air quality will prove the more embarrassing problem next August .
Television coverage of athletes gasping for breath will hardly provide Beijing with the signature Olympic image it had in mind , and growing international anxiety over climate change and other environmental hazards will ensure that such issues receive considerable media coverage .
There is also the risk that the Games will become a political circus , as the international spotlight generates irresistible opportunities for public protest .
The Chinese leadership has demonstrated many times that it can quell domestic dissent , but the unique scale of the Olympics will require round ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## clock vigilance .
Activists with grievances over Tibet , Taiwan , Burma , Darfur , and dozens of other political , environmental , and human ##AT##-##AT## rights issues are already making plans .
Is China ready for Greenpeace , Human Rights in China , Amnesty International , and Falun Gong supporters to take to the streets , with thousands of foreign journalists hungry for stories and asking questions that the authorities are unaccustomed to answering ?
Even if police are able to maintain order in Beijing , can they extend that control across the country ?
Can they manage the flow of information and ideas through the blogosphere as online activists open yet another front in their battle for free information ?
What we do know that Chinese officials have never faced a challenge of this scale with such a potential to both win and lose face .
The Games will generate significant foreign ##AT##-##AT## policy risks as well .
In Taiwan , outgoing President Chen Shui ##AT##-##AT## bian is stirring the independence pot , knowing that the Olympic spotlight will limit Beijing ’ s ability to respond forcefully .
He has already proposed a popular referendum on Taiwanese membership in the United Nations .
China ’ s influence within the UN would prevent such a move even if Taiwan voted yes , but an international confrontation is the last thing China wants coinciding with the Olympics .
Then there is the matter of how the Games will be received in the West .
Since 2001 , China has increasingly become the focal point of much anxiety in the developed world .
Huge bilateral trade deficits , accusations that China keeps its currency undervalued , and a rash of defective and dangerous Chinese ##AT##-##AT## made exports have fueled a protectionist backlash in the United States and Europe .
Amid bitter election ##AT##-##AT## year debates over Iraq and Iran , and a souring economic outlook , Americans may be in no mood for the triumphalist pageantry of a new rising power on display in Beijing .
Will China ’ s uneasy Asian neighbors be any more receptive ?
International criticism is sure to follow if something , anything , goes wrong during the Games , especially if it involves the suppression of dissent and is vectored around the world via 24 ##AT##-##AT## hour cable television and the Internet .
China has changed since it “ won ” the 2008 games seven years ago .
The Party leadership has grown more self ##AT##-##AT## assured in its growing international role , but its ability to manage the pace of change at home has become more uncertain .
In 2001 , then President Jiang Zemin hoped the Games would herald China ’ s arrival as an industrialized power .
But his successor , Hu Jintao , has focused on the damage that has come from unrestrained growth .
He and Premier Wen Jiabao have also championed a more “ harmonious ” society , because they understand that the growing wealth gap , social tensions , environmental and public health problems , and the Party ’ s tenuous relationship with China ’ s less advantaged people can no longer be neglected .
As China ’ s leaders scramble to address these challenges , will they still relish the idea of providing an international audience with front ##AT##-##AT## row seats ?
How they look back on the Games once the confetti is swept from the streets is far from certain .
NEW YORK – China ’ s willingness to join negotiations on potential sanctions against Iran and to send President Hu Jintao to a nuclear security summit in Washington this month are important preliminary steps towards taking more responsibility in managing international affairs .
But merely joining conversations or showing up for meetings is not enough .
Given its growing profile , China must do far more to demonstrate its bona fides as a responsible global leader or risk undermining the system that has enabled its own miraculous rise .
China has emerged as a world power far more quickly than most observers – and China ’ s own leaders – might have predicted as little as a decade ago .
China ’ s rapid economic growth , juxtaposed against America ’ s problems in Iraq and Afghanistan , monumental debt , and role in sparking the global financial crisis , have changed global power realities – and global perceptions of those realities even more .
China ’ s current international influence likely outstrips its desire or capacity .
This puts China in a difficult position in relation to the so ##AT##-##AT## called international system – the structures and rules created by the United States and others after the Second World War to check national sovereignty through a system of overlapping jurisdictions , transnational obligations , and fundamental rights .
China has been an enormous beneficiary of this system , and its rise would have been unthinkable without the US ##AT##-##AT## led free ##AT##-##AT## trade system and globalization process , access to US markets , and global shipping lanes secured by the US Navy .
But China ’ s history of humiliation at the hands of European colonial powers has made its leaders ardent supporters of inviolable national rights and suspicious of any sacrifice of sovereignty .
Because China ’ s leaders are not popularly elected , their legitimacy stems largely from two sources – their connection to the Chinese revolution and their ability to deliver national security and economic growth .
Although Mao Zedong is widely implicated in the unnecessary death of millions and is officially designated by the current regime as having been 30 % wrong , his photograph still adorns Tiananmen Square , because the regime ’ s legitimacy depends in part on its connection to the restoration of national sovereignty that Mao represents .
The economic foundation of the Chinese government ’ s legitimacy also places an enormous burden on China ’ s leaders to make decisions that foster domestic economic growth at the expense of virtually everything else – including , some say , the viability of the international currency regime , nuclear non ##AT##-##AT## proliferation , and basic rights in resource ##AT##-##AT## rich countries .
This dichotomy creates a difficult situation as China emerges as the world ’ s second largest economy .
If China , in the name of national sovereignty , does not buy into the international system , it becomes hard to argue that this system exists .
China ’ s unwillingness , for example , to join other members of the international community in pressuring Iran and North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons programs foreshadows the potential collapse of the nuclear non ##AT##-##AT## proliferation regime .
China ’ s active courtship of countries that violate human rights on a massive scale , such as Sudan , North Korea , and Burma , similarly represents a preliminary decapitation of the international human rights regime .
Given its size and importance , and regardless of its intentions , China will , perhaps inadvertently , destroy the international system if it does not either actively endorse and work to maintain it , or reframe it for the greater common good .
If it does neither , the world is in trouble .
If China sees itself as the heir and beneficiary of the US ##AT##-##AT## led post ##AT##-##AT## war international system , it must do much more to prevent and roll back nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea , pay a much greater percentage of costs for the United Nations , and curtail its mercantilist policies .
It must also end its alleged corrupt practices in resource ##AT##-##AT## rich parts of the developing world , align its currency policy with global norms , lead efforts to curb greenhouse ##AT##-##AT## gas emissions , and , more generally , take into more account the fate of people outside of China in its decision ##AT##-##AT## making .
If , on the other hand , as is its right , Chinese leaders have an alternative vision of what an improved international system might look like , the onus is on them to articulate that vision and outline what they are willing to do to realize it .
There may be a better international model than the current one , but it will not emerge by default .
As US Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman demonstrated in the 1940 ’ s , such a system must be articulated and then forged through decisive action and global leadership .
If China sees inviolable state sovereignty as the foundation of twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century international affairs , as now appears to be the case , then it must explain why this principle will not lead to the same disastrous consequences as it did in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries .
The US and the international community must acknowledge that today ’ s fast ##AT##-##AT## rising China has earned the right to play an important role in shaping how the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century unfolds .
But if China ’ s leaders will neither do more to support the current international system , nor articulate an alternative , and instead continue to hark back to nineteenth ##AT##-##AT## century models of inviolable sovereignty , they will destroy a global order that , warts and all , has served the world exceedingly well .
Those countries that value the current system will increasingly feel the urge to close ranks to defend it .
CAMBRIDGE – Thirty years ago , China had a tiny footprint on the global economy and little influence outside its borders , save for a few countries with which it had close political and military relationships .
Today , the country is a remarkable economic power : the world ’ s manufacturing workshop , its foremost financier , a leading investor across the globe from Africa to Latin America , and , increasingly , a major source of research and development .
The Chinese government sits atop an astonishing level of foreign reserves – greater than $ 2 trillion .
There is not a single business anywhere in the world that has not felt China ’ s impact , either as a low ##AT##-##AT## cost supplier , or more threateningly , as a formidable competitor .
China is still a poor country .
Although average incomes have risen very rapidly in recent decades , they still stand at between one ##AT##-##AT## seventh and one ##AT##-##AT## eighth the levels in the United States – lower than in Turkey or Colombia and not much higher than in El Salvador or Egypt .
While coastal China and its major metropolises evince tremendous wealth , large swaths of Western China remain mired in poverty .
Nevertheless , China ’ s economy is projected to surpass that of the US in size sometime in the next two decades .
Meanwhile , the US , the world ’ s sole economic hyper ##AT##-##AT## power until recently , remains a diminished giant . It stands humbled by its foreign ##AT##-##AT## policy blunders and a massive financial crisis .
Its credibility after the disastrous invasion of Iraq is at an all ##AT##-##AT## time low , notwithstanding the global sympathy for President Barack Obama , and its economic model is in tatters .
The once ##AT##-##AT## almighty dollar totters at the mercy of China and the oil ##AT##-##AT## rich states .
All of which raises the question of whether China will eventually replace the US as the world ’ s hegemon , the global economy ’ s rule setter and enforcer .
In a fascinating new book , revealingly titled When China Rules the World , the British scholar and journalist Martin Jacques is unequivocal : if you think China will be integrated smoothly into a liberal , capitalist , and democratic world system , Jacques argues , you are in for a big surprise .
Not only is China the next economic superpower , but the world order that it will construct will look very different from what we have had under American leadership .
Americans and Europeans blithely assume that China will become more like them as its economy develops and its population gets richer .
This is a mirage , Jacques says .
The Chinese and their government are wedded to a different conception of society and polity : community ##AT##-##AT## based rather than individualist , state ##AT##-##AT## centric rather than liberal , authoritarian rather than democratic .
China has 2,000 years of history as a distinct civilization from which to draw strength .
It will not simply fold under Western values and institutions .
A world order centered on China will reflect Chinese values rather than Western ones , Jacques argues .
Beijing will overshadow New York , the renminbi will replace the dollar , Mandarin will take over from English , and schoolchildren around the world will learn about Zheng He ’ s voyages of discovery along the Eastern coast of Africa rather than about Vasco de Gama or Christopher Columbus .
Gone will be the evangelism of markets and democracy .
China is much less likely to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states .
But , in return , it will demand that smaller , less powerful states explicitly recognize China ’ s primacy ( just as in the tributary systems of old ) .
Before any of this comes to pass , however , China will have to continue its rapid economic growth and maintain its social cohesion and political unity . None of this is guaranteed .
Beneath China ’ s powerful economic dynamo lie deep tensions , inequalities , and cleavages that could well derail a smooth progression to global hegemony .
Throughout its long history , centrifugal forces have often pushed the country into disarray and disintegration .
China ’ s stability hinges critically on its government ’ s ability to deliver steady economic gains to the vast majority of the population .
China is the only country in the world where anything less than 8 % growth year after year is believed to be dangerous because it would unleash social unrest .
Most of the rest of the world only dreams about growth at that rate , which speaks volumes about the underlying fragility of the Chinese system .
The authoritarian nature of the political regime is at the core of this fragility .
It allows only repression when the government faces protests and opposition outside the established channels .
The trouble is that it will become increasingly difficult for China to maintain the kind of growth that it has experienced in recent years . China ’ s growth currently relies on an undervalued currency and a huge trade surplus .
This is unsustainable , and sooner or later it will precipitate a major confrontation with the US ( and Europe ) .
There are no easy ways out of this dilemma .
China will likely have to settle for lower growth .
If China surmounts these hurdles and does eventually become the world ’ s predominant economic power , globalization will , indeed , take on Chinese characteristics .
Democracy and human rights will then likely lose their luster as global norms .
That is the bad news .
The good news is that a Chinese global order will display greater respect for national sovereignty and more tolerance for national diversity .
There will be greater room for experimentation with different economic models .
Communist China has experienced a monumental capitalist revolution in the last two decades , with an economy that is now six times bigger than it was 20 years ago .
A minor player in the global economy in the 1980 ’ s , China today is the world ’ s third largest trading power .
But if these stunning economic statistics make you think that so much capitalist development must also have brought more democracy to China , think again .
Most Westerners believe in a theory of liberal evolution , according to which sustained economic growth , by increasing wealth and the size of the middle class , gradually makes a country more democratic .
While the long ##AT##-##AT## run record of this theory is irrefutable , China ’ s authoritarian ruling elite is not only determined to hold on to power , but it also has been smart enough to take adaptive measures aimed at countering the liberalizing effects of economic development .
Thus , for all its awe ##AT##-##AT## inspiring economic achievement , China has made remarkably little progress in political liberalization .
Indeed , judging by several key indicators , progress toward democracy in China has stalled , despite unprecedented economic prosperity and personal freedom .
For instance , in the mid ##AT##-##AT## 1980 ’ s , Chinese leaders seriously discussed and later drew up a blueprint for modest democratic reforms .
Today , the topic of political reform is taboo .
Nearly all the major institutional reforms , such as strengthening the legislature , holding village elections , and building a modern legal system , were launched in the 1980 ’ s .
Since the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989 , however , not a single major democratic reform initiative has been implemented .
Instead of democratic transition , China has witnessed a consolidation of authoritarian rule – the strengthening of a one ##AT##-##AT## party regime through organizational learning and adaptation .
Since 1989 , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) has been pursuing a two ##AT##-##AT## pronged strategy : selective repression that targets organized political opposition and co ##AT##-##AT## optation of new social elites ( the intelligentsia , professionals , and private entrepreneurs ) .
This strategy emphasizes the maintenance of an extensive law enforcement apparatus designed to eliminate any incipient organized opposition .
Huge investments have strengthened the People ’ s Armed Police ( PAP ) , a large anti ##AT##-##AT## riot paramilitary force whose specialty is the quick suppression of anti ##AT##-##AT## government protests by disgruntled industrial workers , peasants , and urban residents .
Frequent deployment of the PAP is a major reason why the tens of thousands of collective protests that occur each year ( 74,000 in 2004 and 86,000 in 2005 ) have had a negligible impact on China ’ s overall stability .
To deal with new emerging political threats , such as the information revolution , the Chinese government has spent mightily on manpower and technology .
A special 30,000 ##AT##-##AT## strong police unit monitors and screens Internet traffic , advanced technology is deployed to block access to overseas Web sites considered “ hostile or harmful , ” and Internet service and content providers , both domestic and Western , must comply with onerous restrictions designed to suppress political dissent and track down offenders .
The regime has even conducted multi ##AT##-##AT## agency exercises to test whether different government bodies could cooperate closely to keep “ harmful information ” off the Net during an emergency .
Having learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that a bureaucratic ruling party must co ##AT##-##AT## opt new social elites to deprive potential opposition groups of leaders , the Communist Party has conducted an effective campaign of expanding its social base .
The urban intelligentsia and professionals have been pampered with material perks and political recognition , while new private entrepreneurs have been allowed to join the Party .
This strategy of pre ##AT##-##AT## emptive political decapitation has produced enormous dividends for the Party .
In the 1980 ’ s , its principal adversaries were the urban intelligentsia , who constituted the backbone of the pro ##AT##-##AT## democracy movement that culminated in Tiananmen Square .
Today , the mainstream of the Chinese intelligentsia is an integral part of the ruling elite .
Many have joined the Party and become government officials , and a large percentage enjoy various professional and financial privileges .
Predictably , the intelligentsia , usually the most liberal social group , is no longer a lethal threat to party rule .
Worse , without support from this strategic group , other social groups , such as workers and peasants , have become politically marginalized and rudderless .
Although the Party ’ s carrot ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## stick approach has worked since 1989 , it is doubtful that it will retain its efficacy for another 17 years .
To the extent that China ’ s authoritarian regime is by nature exclusionary ( it can only incorporate a limited number of elites ) , the co ##AT##-##AT## optation strategy will soon run up against its limits , and the Party will no longer have the resources to buy off the intelligentsia or keep private entrepreneurs happy .
At the same time , selective repression can contain social frustrations and discontent only temporarily .
As long as much of Chinese society views the current political system as unjust , unresponsive , and corrupt , there will always be a large reservoir of ill will toward the ruling elites .
When things go wrong – as is likely , given mounting social strains caused by rising inequality , environmental degradation , and deteriorating public services – China ’ s alienated masses could become politically radicalized .
And , unlike past protests , which have usually been allied with students or members of the intelligentsia , popular disaffection might not have the virtue of rational leaders with whom the government could talk and negotiate .
So it may be premature for the Party to celebrate the success of its adaptive strategy .
China ’ s rulers may have stalled democratic trends for now , but the current strategy has , perhaps , merely delayed the inevitable .
On October 1 , 1949 , as Chiang Kai ##AT##-##AT## chek &apos;s defeated Kuomintang ( KMT ) troops fled for Taiwan , Mao Zedong declared that &quot; China has stood up . &quot;
China has , indeed , stood up , and continues to rise as one of the world &apos;s largest economies .
Last year , China alone accounted for roughly 60 % of global export growth .
But in a crisis , China &apos;s diplomatic influence usually resembles that of some peripheral backwater .
Nowhere does this seem truer than in China &apos;s own backyard .
Beijing &apos;s seeming silence over the nuclear ambitions of North Korea has left US , Japanese , and South Korean officials alike wondering when it will &quot; stand up &quot; to assert its influence over its neighbor and erstwhile ally .
One reason China seems paralyzed in the current crisis is that , among the world &apos;s major powers , it is almost alone in having a genuine &quot; two Koreas &quot; policy .
Since China established diplomatic relations with South Korea in the early l990 &apos;s , economic ties have grown dramatically , and cultural relations have expanded at a comparable pace .
China also reciprocated outgoing President Kim Dae ##AT##-##AT## jung &apos;s overtures in the political ##AT##-##AT## security realm , despite South Korea &apos;s strategic ties with the US .
But in recognizing South Korea , China took greater care than , say , Russia , in seeking to ameliorate North Korea &apos;s anxieties .
China is North Korea &apos;s most important trading partner , with turnover exceeding $ 700 million in 2002 , up 30 % from 2001 .
Indeed , China is believed to supply about 70 % of the North &apos;s oil , and has doubled its sales of grain and vegetables .
While China no longer promises the North military support ( except in the event of external attack ) , &quot; consultations &quot; are pledged .
Privately , China &apos;s leaders are dubious ( at best ) about North Korea .
They think that economic reform is long overdue , and , like others , consider Kim Jong ##AT##-##AT## il &apos;s political system bizarre .
For their part , North Korea &apos;s elite understands that they have no true allies at present , not even in Beijing .
Yet Kim Jong ##AT##-##AT## il &apos;s two trips to China illustrate his interest in China &apos;s reforms and his desire to cultivate China &apos;s support .
How much the Chinese know about the inner workings of North Korea &apos;s policy ##AT##-##AT## making and power structure , and how much influence they can have , are uncertain .
China claims that its power over Pyongyang is limited .
What China wants above all is to prevent North Korea from collapsing , whatever the cause .
Conflict on the Korean peninsula , nourished by the vitriolic language often employed by Kim Jong ##AT##-##AT## il &apos;s regime , is China &apos;s nightmare .
War between the Koreas would confront Beijing with a flood of hundreds of thousands of refugees .
Equally important , China is wary of the prospect of Korea being unified under South Korean rule and backed up by continued strategic support from the US .
Fortunately , North Korea &apos;s leaders prefer survival to suicide .
They know that despite the extensive damage that they could inflict on the South , in the end , they would be destroyed by American and South Korean power if combat ever starts .
Hence , war initiated by the North , while not unthinkable , seems unlikely .
A third possibility is an indefinite continuation of the status quo .
This , too , seems doubtful .
North Korea is a failing state economically , a fact that Kim Jong ##AT##-##AT## il and his cronies appear to recognize .
Since the mid ##AT##-##AT## l990 &apos;s , they have been exploring--albeit cautiously and uncertainly--avenues of change , including flawed price liberalization many prices in mid ##AT##-##AT## 2002 .
Whatever the eventual outcome , the status quo is untenable .
A fourth alternative , favored by China and other key players , is an evolutionary process that combines economic reform with increased interaction with the external world , focusing initially on South Korea .
China will move carefully but firmly in promoting this path .
It is anxious to see a US ##AT##-##AT## North Korea dialogue begin , one capable of alleviating the North &apos;s anxieties about an American attack and America &apos;s concerns about a renewed nuclear program .
Indeed , the main factor fueling the current crisis and complicating its resolution is that the North has only one bargaining chip : threats .
Aside from a pledge of non ##AT##-##AT## aggression , its central interest is in obtaining economic assistance .
Yet the US and others are wary of being labeled appeasers .
Well aware of the complexities and hazards--and seeking to avoid alienating any of the parties--China is willing to play the role of convener , but not adjudicator , of an American ##AT##-##AT## North Korean dialogue .
Thus , its proclaimed &quot; disagreement &quot; with North Korea &apos;s withdrawal from the Non ##AT##-##AT## Proliferation Treaty was relatively mild .
Nonetheless , China &apos;s stake in the outcome of the current crisis is big enough to make it a party to a wide range of exchanges , formal and informal , bilateral and multilateral--all with the objective of promoting change without upheaval on the Korean peninsula .
In this respect , the US and China have common interests , as do Japan , Russia , and South Korea .
China , too , believes that if advocates of &quot; regime change &quot; do not push North Korea too hard , a strategy can be pursued that is based on slow evolution rather than a precipitous break--and a possible violent breakdown .
NEWPORT BEACH – When it comes to describing Europe ’ s ever ##AT##-##AT## worsening crisis , metaphors abound .
For some , it is five minutes to midnight ; for others , Europe is a car accelerating towards the edge of a cliff .
For all , a perilous existential moment is increasingly close at hand .
Optimists – fortunately , there remain a few , especially in Europe itself – believe that when the situation becomes really critical , political leaders will turn things around and put Europe back on the path of economic growth , job creation , and financial stability .
But pessimists have been growing in number and influence .
They see political dysfunction adding to financial turmoil , thereby amplifying the eurozone ’ s initial design flaws .
Of course , who is ultimately proven correct is a function of eurozone governments ’ willingness to make the difficult decisions that are required , and in a coordinated and timely fashion .
But that is not the only determinant : governments must also be able to turn things around once the willingness to do so materializes .
And here , the endless delays are making the challenges more daunting and the outcome more uncertain .
Experienced observers remind us that crises , rather than vision , have tended to drive progress at critical stages of Europe ’ s historic integration – a multi ##AT##-##AT## decade journey driven by the desire to ensure long ##AT##-##AT## term peace and prosperity in what previously had been one of the world ’ s most violent regions and the site of appalling human suffering .
After all , the European Union ( including the eurozone ’ s 17 members ) remains a collective of nation ##AT##-##AT## states with notable divergences in economic , financial , and social conditions .
Cultural differences persist .
Political cycles are far from synchronized .
And too many regional governance mechanisms , with the important exception of the European Central Bank , lack sufficient influence , credibility , and , therefore , effectiveness .
Left to its own devices , such a grouping is vulnerable to recurrent bickering , disruptive posturing , and disagreement over visions of the future .
As a result , progress towards meaningful economic and political integration can be painfully slow during the good times .
But all of this can change rapidly when a crisis looms , especially if it threatens the integrity of the European project .
That is where the eurozone is today .
A debt crisis that erupted in Greece , the eurozone ’ s outer periphery , has migrated with a vengeance towards the core , so much so that the survival of the eurozone itself is at stake .
The more the policy response has lagged , the broader the set of questions about Europe ’ s future has become .
Maintaining a 17 ##AT##-##AT## member monetary union is no longer a given .
Talk of countries exiting , starting with Greece ( the “ Grexit ” ) , is now rampant .
And only hard ##AT##-##AT## core idealists dismiss altogether the mounting risk of the eurozone ’ s total disintegration .
Nonetheless , many veterans of the European integration project see a silver lining in the dark clouds massing over their creation .
For them , only a crisis can stop politicians from just kicking various cans farther down the road and , instead , catalyze the policy initiatives – greater fiscal , banking , and political union – that , together with monetary union , would ensure that the eurozone rests on a stable and sustainable four ##AT##-##AT## legged platform .
But this view is not without its own risks .
It assumes that , when push comes to shove , political leaders will indeed do what is necessary – the willingness question .
It also presumes that they will have the capacity to do so – the ability question .
And , over time , uncertainty concerning the latter question has risen to an uncomfortable level .
Today ’ s eurozone is beset by an unprecedented degree of rejection – on economic , financial , political , and social grounds – &amp; nbsp ; by citizens in a growing number of countries .
The longer this persists , the harder it will be for politicians to maintain control of their countries ’ destinies and that of Europe ’ s collective enterprise .
Private ##AT##-##AT## sector activity is slowing , and it is nearing a standstill in the eurozone ’ s most vulnerable economy ( Greece ) , where a bank run is in full swing .
Elsewhere , too , depositors are beginning to transfer their savings to the strongest economy ( Germany ) and to safe havens beyond ( Switzerland and the United States ) .
Weaker companies are shedding labor , while stronger firms are delaying investments in plant and equipment .
And global investors continue to exit the eurozone in droves , shifting countries ’ liabilities to taxpayers and the ECB ’ s balance sheet .
No wonder that social unrest is evident in a growing number of countries .
No wonder that fringe political movements are gaining traction throughout the eurozone .
And no wonder that voters in almost two ##AT##-##AT## thirds of eurozone countries have turned out the incumbents in their most recent elections .
All of this serves to undermine the effectiveness of government policies – by reducing their credibility , clogging their channels of transmission to the economy , and making it difficult to offset the withdrawal of private ##AT##-##AT## sector capital and spending .
As a result , the market ##AT##-##AT## based economic and financial systems that prevail in Europe , and that , not so long ago , were a source of significant strength , are losing their vibrancy .
I , too , am fond of metaphors .
During a trip to the continent last week , I heard one that captures very well the key dynamic in Europe today .
The eurozone ’ s leaders are on a raft heading towards a life ##AT##-##AT## threatening waterfall .
The longer they wait , the more the raft gains speed .
So the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooperate in order to navigate the raft to safety .
It also hinges on their ability to do so in the midst of natural forces that are increasingly difficult to control and overcome .
The message is clear .
The current crisis might indeed eventually break eurozone leaders ’ inherent resistance to compromise , collaboration , and common action .
But the longer they bicker and dither , the greater the risk that what they gain in willingness will be lost to incapacity .
President George W. Bush will soon travel to Europe , and President Jacques Chirac will visit Washington .
EU “ Foreign Minister ” Javier Solana has already been there , and returned bullish on future transatlantic cooperation .
Atmospherically , at least , relations have , indeed , improved since the US presidential election , and both sides have expressed good will .
Yet there is little ground for genuine optimism .
Bush ’ s declared intention to “ better explain the reasons for his decisions ” to America ’ s Allies simply will not do .
Europeans don ’ t want explanations ; they want to be consulted – to have input into American decision ##AT##-##AT## making and see their concerns reflected in US foreign policy .
None of this is likely to happen .
On the contrary , the US is continuing to thwart European efforts gradually to establish a rule ##AT##-##AT## based international order .
There are no signs that the Bush administration is relenting on , for example , the UN , the Kyoto Protocol , the International Criminal Court , the ban on land mines , or the Anti ##AT##-##AT## Ballistic Missile Treaty .
In Iraq , Europeans fully share the American objectives of preserving the country ’ s unity and achieving at least some modicum of democracy .
At the same time , they believe that it is up to the US to remove the chaos it created , so they are reluctant to contribute to the task in a substantive way .
European attitudes may seem shortsighted to Americans , but it would need a lot of cajoling to change them .
There is general agreement on the aims to be achieved in the Israeli ##AT##-##AT## Palestinian conflict : the end of violence and a peaceful solution based on the concept of two sovereign states .
However , Europeans consider the opinion recently expressed by Bush – that Palestinian democracy and not Israeli occupation of the West Bank is at the core of the problem – to be ill conceived .
The same is true with respect to the President ’ s assertion that Israel ’ s permanent presence in Palestinian territories and the non ##AT##-##AT## return of Palestinian refugees to their homes in Israel must be accepted as realities on the ground .
It may well be that such painful deviations from agreed principles will be reflected in an eventual comprehensive settlement , but prejudging these issues before the beginning of negotiations denies the Palestinians some of their most important bargaining chips .
On the question of Iran ’ s nuclear weapons capability , Americans and Europeans also fundamentally agree : it should be prevented .
While the US tries to achieve this through hard power , regime change , sanctions , and threats of pre ##AT##-##AT## emptive military intervention , Europe uses soft power , diplomacy , inclusion , and partnership .
Unfortunately , this “ good cop , bad cop ” game doesn ’ t work in international politics .
European efforts to induce Teheran to renounce its nuclear designs by addressing Iran ’ s legitimate security concerns and offering important opportunities for economic and social betterment cannot be successful without active US support .
In other words , Europe ’ s carrots are not enough ; a successful outcome requires American carrots , too .
By standing aside and discounting the European approach from the outset , America is merely helping to bring about a self ##AT##-##AT## fulfilling prophecy .
It would be more productive for the US to join in , at the same time agreeing with Europeans on measures to be taken should their combined efforts fail .
Relations with China have improved over the years on both sides of the Atlantic .
China has become Europe ’ s biggest trading partner , and its huge reserves of US dollars has made it America ’ s most important creditor .
Despite this rosy picture , China could be the cause of a major transatlantic row if Europeans make good on their intention to lift the arms export embargo in place since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 .
The Bush administration is fiercely opposed to lifting the embargo , pointing out that in the event of a military clash over Taiwan , US troops would face weapons provided to China by America ’ s own allies .
In fact , European assurances that arms sales to China could be controlled and threats to an ally avoided do appear unconvincing .
On the other hand , economic interdependence between Taiwan and mainland China has grown to such an extent that an armed conflict is increasingly unlikely .
Of course , this would change were Taiwan to push for independence , but it would hardly do so without a nod from Washington .
In short , on many of the most important current international issues , Americans and Europeans share the same objectives and basic goals .
Where they often diverge is in the means to achieve them .
Political wisdom would demand that the two sides pool their considerable resources and march together whenever possible .
This , however , requires a change of attitudes both in America and in Europe .
Bush must be willing to accept Europeans as genuine partners and stop treating them like recalcitrant vassals .
European leaders must overcome any latent Anti ##AT##-##AT## Americanism and be prepared to make the kind of contributions to common endeavors that would entitle them to equal partnership with the US .
STOCKHOLM – What will Europe ’ s growth trajectory look like after the financial crisis ?
For some Europeans , still nervous that their economies and banking systems might collapse , this is a little like asking a passenger on the Titanic what they plan to do when they arrive in New York .
But it is a crucial question to ask , especially when Europe has been facing so much outside pressure from the likes of the United States and the International Monetary Fund to focus on short ##AT##-##AT## term Keynesian stimulus policies .
True , things are pretty ugly right now .
Europe ’ s income is projected to fall a staggering 4 % this year .
Unemployment will soon be in double digits throughout most of the Continent , with Spanish and Latvian unemployment on track to exceed 20 % .
Europe ’ s banking system remains sickly , even though many national governments have gone to great lengths to hide their banks ’ woes .
Yet , ugly or not , the downturn will eventually end .
Yes , there is still a real risk of hitting an iceberg , beginning perhaps with a default in the Baltics , with panic first spreading to Austria and some Nordic countries .
But , for now , a complete meltdown seems distinctly less likely than gradual stabilization followed by a tepid recovery , with soaring debt levels and lingering high unemployment .
It is not a pretty picture .
Some commentators have savaged Europe ’ s policymakers for not orchestrating as aggressive a fiscal and monetary policy as their US counterparts have .
Why else is Europe suffering a deeper recession than America , they complain , when everyone agrees that the US was the epicenter of the global financial meltdown ?
But these critics seem to presume that Europe will come out of the crisis in far worse shape than the US , and it is too early to make that judgment .
An epic , financial ##AT##-##AT## crisis ##AT##-##AT## driven recession , such as the one we are still experiencing , is not a one ##AT##-##AT## year event .
So policymakers ’ responses cannot be evaluated by short ##AT##-##AT## term measures , either .
It is just as important to ask what happens over the next five years as over the next six months , and the jury is still very much out on that .
America ’ s hyper ##AT##-##AT## aggressive fiscal response means a faster rise in government debt , while its hyper ##AT##-##AT## expansive monetary policy means that an exit strategy to mop up all the excess liquidity will be difficult to execute .
Government spending in the US has risen in short order from 18 % to 28 % of income , while the US Federal Reserve has effectively tripled its balance sheet .
Europe ’ s more tempered approach , while magnifying short ##AT##-##AT## term risks , could pay off in the long run , especially if global interest rates rise , making it far more painful to carry oversized debt loads .
The real question is not whether Europe is using sufficiently aggressive Keynesian stimulus , but whether Europe will resume its economic reform efforts as the crisis abates .
If Europe continues to make its labor markets more flexible , its financial market regulation more genuinely pan ##AT##-##AT## European , and remains open to trade , trend growth can pick up again in the wake of the crisis .
If European countries look inward , however , with Germany pushing its consumers to buy German cars , the French government forcing car companies to keep unproductive factories open , etc . , one can expect a decade of stagnation .
Admittedly , the past year has not been a proud one for policy reform in Europe .
Recessions have never proven an easy time for European leaders to push forward with reforms .
Matters were not helped when the Czech government lost a confidence vote midway through its six ##AT##-##AT## month presidency of the European Union , leaving a lame duck European Commission .
The shadow of forthcoming elections in Germany , together with concern over whether Irish voters will ratify the Lisbon treaty ( giving Europe a badly needed new constitution ) , has conspired to impede reform momentum .
Yet Europe ’ s many strengths , including strong democratic governments and sound legal institutions , are often under ##AT##-##AT## rated as long ##AT##-##AT## term competitive strengths in today ’ s globalized economy .
The recent recession has presented challenges , but European leaders were right to avoid becoming intoxicated with short ##AT##-##AT## term Keynesian policies , especially where these are inimical to addressing Europe ’ s long ##AT##-##AT## term challenges .
If reform resumes , there is no reason why Europe should not enjoy a decade of per capita income growth at least as high as that of the US .
Moreover , with growing concerns about the sustainability of US fiscal policy , the euro has a huge opportunity to play a significantly larger role as a reserve currency .
One shudders to think what will happen if Europe does not pull out of its current funk .
Certainly , Europe would lose traction as a badly needed counterweight to the US in world economic policy .
Europeans may not mind this right now ( one sees more Obama t ##AT##-##AT## shirts in Europe than in the US ) , but they might not be so happy if a George Bush III comes along .
Fortunately , Europeans will probably not wait so long to start moving ahead again .
Over the last two decades Europe experienced a dramatic expansion of financial markets at the expense of its traditional system of financing based on close relationships between large banks and established firms .
Since 1980 the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP soared more than 13 ##AT##-##AT## fold , while equity financing rose 16 ##AT##-##AT## fold .
In 1980 , stock market capitalization relative to GDP was five times greater in the US and UK than in Continental Europe ; by 2000 , it was only 60 % higher .
Disclosure standards improved throughout the Continent , as did laws to protect minority shareholders .
For example , before 1980 no member of today &apos;s European Union , except France and Sweden , had an anti ##AT##-##AT## insider trading law--and in Sweden the law , although introduced in 1971 , was not enforced for the first time until 1990 .
By 2000 , all EU members had anti ##AT##-##AT## insider trading laws and most were enforcing them .
What caused this change ?
Is it benefiting all EU countries , and will it persist as EU enlargement proceeds ?
Relationship ##AT##-##AT## based financial systems perform better when markets and firms are smaller , when legal protection is weaker , there is little public information , and innovation is incremental .
Banks tend to have close , long ##AT##-##AT## term , and protective ties with the managers of such firms , primarily because the bank &apos;s holdings are illiquid .
This can provide considerable stability--indeed , the second half of the 20th century saw only four German firms succumb to hostile takeovers--but at the cost of reducing access to finance and curtailing future opportunities .
By contrast , market ##AT##-##AT## based financial systems perform better when economies and firms are bigger and more formally organized , with better legal enforcement and transparency , and when innovation is constant .
A market ##AT##-##AT## based system gives new firms--hence new technologies--more chances to obtain financing , because many investors assess firms independently .
But financial systems do not emerge as a result of their superiority in a particular environment .
Vested interests distort the process of evolution .
Over the last decade , trade liberalization and monetary integration supported the expansion of market ##AT##-##AT## based financing in Europe .
Trade integration exposed domestic banks and firms to foreign competition , limiting national governments &apos; ability to intervene on behalf of favored domestic companies .
Similarly , the European Commission deemed subsidies to publicly ##AT##-##AT## owned firms illegal if they distorted competition across member states , while the fiscal discipline imposed by the Euro ended pervasive general government credit subsidies--the essential lubricant of relationship ##AT##-##AT## based systems .
Moreover , the volume of corporate debt securities almost tripled after the introduction of the Euro eliminated exchange ##AT##-##AT## rate risk .
The European Commission also opened up the market for corporate control by vetoing the barriers against hostile takeovers that most EU governments had erected .
But now that Europe &apos;s internal economic boundaries have been mostly removed , and the political objective has shifted to political unification , integration may no longer be so market ##AT##-##AT## friendly .
The more political power is centralized , the more the central authority can interfere with market development .
The pro ##AT##-##AT## market bias that characterized EU policy up to now ( with notable exceptions , such as agricultural policy ) may well shift in the opposite direction .
In trade zones formed by heterogeneous states , vested interests tend to be diverse and find it hard to lobby at the supranational level .
Political integration , by contrast , might have an opposite effect on the development of markets .
The threat of capital flight to nearby political entities creates a strong incentive to keep policies market ##AT##-##AT## friendly , but it is suppressed when neighboring political entities coalesce .
Incumbent financiers , meanwhile , have a powerful vested interest in opposing a market ##AT##-##AT## based system , which favors credit evaluation and risk management over their main &quot; skill &quot; : being well connected .
They also have the ability to organize successfully against the market , particularly in small countries , where incumbents form a well ##AT##-##AT## defined group whose members often attended the same elite schools , frequent the same clubs , and intermarry .
The question is not whether Europe should move toward a market ##AT##-##AT## based financial system . The real question is whether Europe retains the political will to continue to do so , and whether EU countries can strengthen the institutions necessary to reap the full benefits of financial markets .
There is a serious danger that reforms that facilitate markets will benefit northern Europe but harm underdeveloped regions in southern Europe by depriving them of the relationship ##AT##-##AT## based system .
In these regions , higher rates of corruption and tax evasion , together with smaller average firm size , undermine the production of credible information that financial markets need .
Partly for this reason , EU enlargement is superior--at least for financial markets--to political unification , which encourages vested interests to lobby at the central level .
Indeed , one benefit of the European Commission &apos;s rule that some decisions must be unanimous is that its impedes the exercise of monopoly power , thus reducing the risk that centralized authority will be used against markets .
This is all the more important because leaders in both the US and Europe are beginning to pander to the anti ##AT##-##AT## globalization movement .
America &apos;s corporate scandals have undermined the market &apos;s moral standing , while the end of the Internet bubble has weakened its economic credibility .
The adverse distributive effects of market ##AT##-##AT## based finance may serve to further strengthen anti ##AT##-##AT## market forces in Europe , especially in southern Europe .
The EU can buck this anti ##AT##-##AT## market trend by promoting structural reforms in southern European countries and focussing on enlargement to increase economic competition .
But it should maintain a clear division of power between local and central authorities at all levels to maintain strong competition and a healthy diversity of interests .
Among the many surprises during the Republican Party presidential candidates ’ debates a couple of weeks ago was the rekindled importance of immigration .
After the failure of President George W. Bush ’ s and Senator Edward Kennedy ’ s comprehensive immigration reform effort last spring , most observers thought the matter would remain dormant until 2009 , since even touching it was potentially fatal for Democrats and Republicans alike .
But as Democrats discovered in other recent debates , and as Republicans realized with a little help from the CNN organizers , who skewed the questions toward issues they feel strongly about , immigration is an issue that just won ’ t go away .
This is one reason why I wrote a short but – I hope – useful book on Mexican immigration to the United States , entitled Ex ##AT##-##AT## Mex : From Migrants to Immigrants . Based on internal documents from the Mexican and US governments , countless interviews , and a survey of much of the existing literature on the subject , Ex ##AT##-##AT## Mex seeks to fulfill three purposes .
First , I wanted to provide a Mexican voice in the immigration debate .
Mexicans make up more than half of the flow and stock – legal or not – of all immigrants in the US , but a point of view attempting to reflect their interests and aspirations has been largely absent from the American discussion .
Of course , my book cannot be the Mexican stance .
But an assessment from the vantage point of past , current , and future Mexican immigrants to the US is a necessary component of the American debate – all the more so when one recalls that immigration has , in fact , not generally been exclusively a domestic US policy question .
The first American immigration agreement with another country was signed in 1907 – the so ##AT##-##AT## called Gentleman ’ s Agreement with Japan , while the US and Mexico negotiated and administered the Bracero Program for more than twenty years , from 1942 thru 1964 .
And , of course , the US has had a standing immigration agreement since 1965 with a country most Americans would not imagine : Fidel Castro ’ s Cuba .
Second , it is important to place the current , raging debate in historical context .
The most important feature of that context is that the actual flow of Mexicans entering the US today is not much greater than the overall average figure for the Bracero Program period : around 400,000 per year .
It is similarly important to understand the evolution of US legislation on immigration since the 1920 ’ s , and the shifts and hypocrisy involved in the application of those laws .
For example , the 1996 immigration reforms implemented by the Clinton administration , along with other , underlying structural trends , halted the traditional circular pattern whereby Mexicans came and went to the US every year .
Instead , they began to settle in communities farther from the border , greatly increasing the stock of Mexicans in the US .
Finally , the efforts of the Mexican and US governments since 2001 to reach an accommodation on the issue have not been well understood .
Confidential papers from the Bush and Fox administrations show that talks went further than previously known .
The US , and particularly then ##AT##-##AT## Secretary of State Colin Powell , was willing , as stated in a unclassified memo addressed to Bush in late August 2001 , to go to great lengths to reach an understanding with Mexico on the issue .
Indeed , the substance of the negotiations was not much different from the content of the Bush ##AT##-##AT## Kennedy “ grand bargain ” that was fashioned in 2007 .
The electoral numbers perhaps best explain the immigration equation ’ s importance in today ’ s presidential campaigns .
In 2008 , it is likely that Latinos will make up 9 % to 10 % of the electorate , the highest share ever .
They will wield decisive importance in swing states like Colorado , New Mexico , Florida , and Nevada .
Having made significant inroads among Hispanic voters in 2000 and 2004 , thanks to Bush ’ s support for immigration reform , Republicans now can barely count on 20 % of that total – mainly among Cuban ##AT##-##AT## Americans – thanks to their strident anti ##AT##-##AT## immigration stance .
Thus , if the Democrats demonstrate a minimum of compassion , sensitivity , and realism , they can count on a 7 % advantage in the popular vote .
But doing so could cost Democrats dearly in old industrial states like Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Michigan , where the arrival of Mexican migrants , transformed into immigrants , has stoked passions .
Since the Democrats ’ victory will most likely depend on these states , the Democratic candidate who can square this circle , or the Republican who can break it , may well win the presidency .
BEIJING – Future history books , depending on where they are written , will take one of two approaches to assigning blame for the world ’ s current financial and economic crisis .
One approach will blame lax regulation , accommodating monetary policy , and inadequate savings in the United States .
The other , already being pushed by former and current US officials like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke , will blame the immense pool of liquidity generated by high ##AT##-##AT## savings countries in East Asia and the Middle East .
All that liquidity , they will argue , had to go somewhere . Its logical destination was the country with the deepest financial markets , the US , where it raised asset prices to unsustainable heights .
Note the one thing on which members of both camps agree : the global savings imbalance – low savings in the US and high savings in China and other emerging markets – played a key role in the crisis by allowing Americans to live beyond their means .
It encouraged financiers desperate to earn a return on abundant funds to put them to more speculative use .
If there is a consensus on one issue , it is the impossibility of understanding the bubble and the crash without considering the role of global imbalances .
Preventing future crises similar to this one therefore requires resolving the problem of global imbalances .
Here , the early signs are reassuring .
American households are saving again .
The US trade deficit has declined from $ 60 billion a month to just $ 26 billion , according to the most recent data .
As a matter of simple arithmetic , we know that the rest of the world is running correspondingly smaller surpluses .
But once American households rebuild their retirement accounts , they may return to their profligate ways .
Indeed , the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve are doing all they can to pump up US spending .
The only reason the US trade deficit is falling is that the country remains in a severe recession , causing US imports and exports to collapse in parallel .
With recovery , both may recover to previous levels , and the 6 % -of ##AT##-##AT## GDP US external deficit will be back .
In fact , there has been no change in relative prices or depreciation of the US dollar of a magnitude that would augur a permanent shift in trade and spending patterns .
Whether there is a permanent reduction in global imbalances will depend mainly on decisions taken outside the US , specifically in countries like China .
One ’ s forecast of those decisions hinges , in turn , on why these other countries came to run such large surpluses in the first place .
One view is that their surpluses were a corollary of the policies favoring export ##AT##-##AT## led growth that worked so well for so long . China ’ s leaders are understandably reluctant to abandon a tried ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## true model .
They can ’ t restructure their economy instantaneously .
They can ’ t move workers from painting children ’ s toys in Guangdong to building schools in Western China overnight .
They need time to build a social safety net capable of encouraging Chinese households to reduce their precautionary saving .
If this view is correct , we can expect to see global imbalances re ##AT##-##AT## emerge once the recession is over and to unwind only slowly thereafter .
The other view is that China contributed to global imbalances not through its merchandise exports , but through its capital exports .
What China lacked was not demand for consumption goods , but a supply of high ##AT##-##AT## quality financial assets .
It found these in the US , mainly in the form Treasury and other government ##AT##-##AT## backed securities , in turn pushing other investors into more speculative investments .
Recent events have not enhanced the stature of the US as a supplier of high ##AT##-##AT## quality assets .
And China , for its part , will continue to develop its financial markets and its capacity to generate high ##AT##-##AT## quality financial assets internally .
But doing so will take time .
Meanwhile , the US still has the most liquid financial markets in the world .
This interpretation again implies the re ##AT##-##AT## emergence of global imbalances once the recession ends , and their very gradual unwinding thereafter .
One development that could change this forecast is if China comes to view investing in US financial assets as a money ##AT##-##AT## losing proposition .
US budget deficits as far as the eye can see might excite fear of losses on US Treasury bonds .
A de facto policy of inflating away the debt might stoke such fears further .
At that point , China would pull the plug , the dollar would crash , and the Fed would be forced to raise interest rates , plunging the US back into recession .
There are two hopes for avoiding this disastrous outcome .
One is relying on Chinese goodwill to stabilize the US and world economies .
The other is for the Obama administration and the Fed to provide details about how they will eliminate the budget deficit and avoid inflation once the recession ends .
The second option is clearly preferable .
After all , it is always better to control one ’ s own fate .
CAMBRIDGE – When the financial crisis of 2008 hit , many shocked critics asked why markets , regulators , and financial experts failed to see it coming .
Today , one might ask the same question about the global economy ’ s vulnerability to cyber ##AT##-##AT## attack .
Indeed , the parallels between financial crises and the threat of cyber meltdowns are striking .
Although the greatest cyber threat comes from rogue states with the capacity to develop extremely sophisticated computer viruses , risks can also come from anarchistic hackers and terrorists , or even from computer glitches compounded by natural catastrophe .
A few security experts have voiced great alarm , including , most recently , Jonathan Evans , the head of the British Security Service ( MI5 ) .
By and large , however , few leaders are willing to compromise growth in the tech sector or the Internet in any significant way in the name of a threat that is so amorphous .
Instead , they prefer to establish relatively innocuous working groups and task forces .
It is difficult to overstate the dependence of modern economies on large ##AT##-##AT## scale computer systems .
But imagine if one day a host of key communications satellites were incapacitated , or the databases of major financial systems were erased .
Experts have long identified the electricity grid as the most acute vulnerability , since any modern economy would collapse without power .
True , many skeptics argue that with reasonable low ##AT##-##AT## cost prophylactic measures , large scale cyber ##AT##-##AT## meltdowns are highly implausible , and that doom ##AT##-##AT## mongers overstate the worst ##AT##-##AT## case scenarios .
They say that the ability of cyber ##AT##-##AT## terrorists and blackmailers to take the global economy to the brink , as in the 2007 Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 4 , is utterly fictional .
It is difficult to judge who is right , and there are important experts on both sides of the debate .
But there do seem to be an uncomfortable number of similarities between the political economy of cyberspace regulation and of financial regulation .
First , both cyber ##AT##-##AT## security and financial stability are extremely complex topics with which government regulators can hardly keep up .
Industry remuneration for experts is far in excess of any public ##AT##-##AT## sector salary , and the best minds are continually bid away .
As a result , some argue that the only solution is reliance on self ##AT##-##AT## regulation by the software industry .
One hears this argument for many modern industries , from big food to big pharma to big finance .
Second , like the financial sector , the tech industry is enormously influential politically through contributions and lobbying .
In the United States , all presidential candidates must make pilgrimages to Silicon Valley and other tech centers to raise money .
Excessive financial ##AT##-##AT## sector influence was , of course , a root cause of the 2008 meltdown and remains deeply implicated in today ’ s continuing eurozone mess .
Third , with slowing growth in advanced economies , information technology seems to hold the moral high ground , just as finance did until five years ago .
And crude attempts by governments to enforce regulation are likely to prove ineffective in protecting against catastrophe , while all too effective in strangling growth .
In both cases – financial stability and cyber security – the risk of contagion creates a situation in which a wedge can form between private incentives and social risks .
Admittedly , progress in the technology sector overall often produces huge social ##AT##-##AT## welfare gains , which arguably outstrip those produced by all other sectors in recent decades .
But , just as with nuclear power plants , progress can go awry in the absence of good regulation .
Finally , the greatest risks come from arrogance and ignorance , two human characteristics at the heart of most financial crises .
Recent revelations about the super ##AT##-##AT## viruses “ Stuxnet ” and “ Flame ” are particularly disconcerting .
These viruses , apparently developed by the US and Israel to disrupt Iran ’ s nuclear program , embody a level of sophistication far beyond anything previously seen .
Both are deeply encrypted and difficult to detect once inside a computer .
The Flame virus has the capacity to take over a computer ’ s peripherals , record Skype conversations , take pictures through a computer ’ s camera , and transmit information via Bluetooth to any nearby device .
If the world ’ s most sophisticated governments are developing computer viruses , what guarantee is there that something won ’ t go awry ?
How can we be sure that they won ’ t “ escape ” and infect a much broader class of systems , or be adopted for other uses , or that future rogue states or terrorists won ’ t find a way to turn them on their creators ?
No economy is more vulnerable than the US , and it is arrogance to believe that US cyber superiority ( to all except perhaps China ) provides it with impenetrable security from attack .
Unfortunately the solution is not so simple as just building better anti ##AT##-##AT## virus programs .
Virus protection and virus development constitute an uneven arms race .
A virus can be just a couple hundred lines of computer code , compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti ##AT##-##AT## virus programs , which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies .
We are told not to worry about large ##AT##-##AT## scale cyber meltdowns , because none has occurred , and governments are being vigilant .
Unfortunately , another lesson of the financial crisis is that most politicians are congenitally incapable of making difficult choices until risks actually materialize .
Let us hope that we are lucky for a while longer .
WASHINGTON , DC – Traditionally , “ you should go to the IMF ” was not something you would say to friendly neighbors and close allies .
Over the past few decades , the International Monetary Fund became associated with excessive fiscal austerity , extreme political insensitivity , and – since the Asian financial crisis of 1997 ##AT##-##AT## 1998 – with an out ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## out stigma .
Countries borrowed from the IMF only under duress , when all else failed – and when there was simply no other way to pay for essential imports .
( For Iceland in the fall of 2008 , for example , the only alternative to IMF financing was to eat locally obtained goods , which mostly means fish . )
But the IMF has changed a great deal in recent years , largely under the auspices of Dominique Strauss ##AT##-##AT## Kahn , its current managing director .
Strauss ##AT##-##AT## Kahn , a former French finance minister and contender for the Socialist nomination for the French presidency , has pushed through changes that allow the IMF to lend without conditions in some circumstances , and to give greater priority to protecting social safety nets ( including unemployment benefits and healthcare systems ) .
He has also moved the Fund decisively away from its obsession with fiscal austerity measures ( a big early mistake – with lasting traumatic consequences – in Indonesia and Korea in late 1997 ) .
Greece undoubtedly has serious problems today .
T he great opportunities offered by European integration have been largely squandered .
And lower interest rates over the past decade – brought down to German levels through Greece being allowed , rather generously , into the euro zone – led to little more than further deficits and a dangerous buildup of government debt .
Germany and France – as de facto leaders of the European Union – are haggling over a belated support package , but they have made it abundantly clear that Greece must slash public ##AT##-##AT## sector wages and other spending .
Greek trade unions know what this means – and are in the streets .
If Greece still had its own currency , everything would be easier .
Just as in the case of the United Kingdom since 2008 , the Greek exchange rate would depreciate sharply .
This would lower the cost of labor , restoring competitiveness ( as in Asia after 1997 ##AT##-##AT## 98 ) while also inflating asset prices and thereby helping borrowers who are underwater on their mortgages and other debts .
But , with Greece and other troubled euro ##AT##-##AT## zone economies ( known to their detractors as the PIIGS : Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece , and Spain ) having surrendered monetary policy to the European Central Bank ( ECB ) in Frankfurt , their currencies cannot fall in this fashion .
So Greece – and arguably the PIIGS more generally – are left with the need to curtail demand massively , lower wages , and reduce the public ##AT##-##AT## sector workforce .
The last time we saw this kind of precipitate fiscal austerity – when countries were tied to the gold standard – it contributed directly to the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930 ’ s .
This is a situation tailor ##AT##-##AT## made for Strauss ##AT##-##AT## Kahn and the “ new IMF ” to ride to the rescue .
Since early 2009 , the Fund has had significantly greater resources to lend to countries in trouble , to cushion the blow of crisis , and to offer a form of international circuit ##AT##-##AT## breaker when it looks like the lights might otherwise go out .
The idea is not to prevent necessary adjustments – for example , in the form of budget ##AT##-##AT## deficit reduction – but to spread them out over time , to restore confidence , and to serve as an external seal of approval on a government ’ s credibility .
T he IMF was created in the waning days of World War II , essentially as a United States ##AT##-##AT## West European partnership .
Europe retains strong representation at the Fund , and has always chosen its top leader – in fact , most emerging markets ( in Asia , Latin America , and Africa ) complain that Europe is overrepresented and has far too much say in how the Fund operates .
Yet at this moment of growing European crisis , while there is still time to act , the Fund is confined to the sidelines .
This is partly because German Chancellor Angela Merkel , currently maneuvering to ensure that a German is the next head of the ECB , does not want the Fund to become more involved in euro ##AT##-##AT## zone policies .
The IMF might reasonably take the position that ECB policies have been overly contractionary – resulting in a strong euro and very low inflation – and are no longer appropriate for member countries in the midst of a financial collapse .
If the IMF were to support Europe ’ s weaker economies , this would challenge the prevailing ideology among Frankfurt ##AT##-##AT## dominated policy makers .
But the real reason is much simpler .
When French President Nicolas Sarkozy put forward Strauss ##AT##-##AT## Kahn ’ s name to run the IMF , he meant to park a past and potentially future rival in a faraway place about which people cared little .
Then the global financial crisis hit , and Strauss ##AT##-##AT## Kahn was propelled to center stage .
With France ’ s next presidential election fast approaching in 2012 , the last thing Sarkozy now needs is for Strauss ##AT##-##AT## Kahn to play a statesman ##AT##-##AT## like role in saving the euro zone .
We can expect to hear all kinds of misleading excuses from EU sources for excluding the IMF : “ the Fund is too American , ” “ Europe must resolve its own problems , ” and “ the IMF is not appropriate to our circumstances . ” Given the magnitude of the Greek crisis , they will all ring hollow .
Sometimes history is driven by deep forces beyond our control , and sometimes by sheer chance .
And at other times , like now , much that hangs in the balance is affected by the deliberate , personal , and short ##AT##-##AT## term tactical considerations of people running for election .
The EU ’ s leaders will try hard to keep the IMF at bay .
This is not good news for Greece – or for anyone who cares about global financial stability .
CAMBRIDGE – Greece has bought some time with a new package of financial support , but the country is not out of the woods yet .
It remains to be seen whether the souped ##AT##-##AT## up austerity policies that Prime Minister George Papandreou ’ s government has promised will prove to be politically acceptable and sustainable .
History suggests some grounds for skepticism .
In a democracy , when the demands of financial markets and foreign creditors clash with those of domestic workers , pensioners , and the middle class , it is usually the locals who have the last say .
Britain ’ s exit from the Gold Standard in 1931 remains the historical landmark .
Having made the mistake of restoring parity with gold at a level that left the economy desperately uncompetitive , Britain struggled for several years with deflation and rising unemployment .
Industries such as coal , steel , and shipbuilding were hit hard , and labor strife became rampant .
Even as unemployment reached 20 % , the Bank of England was obliged to maintain high interest rates in order to prevent a massive outflow of gold .
Eventually , increasing financial ##AT##-##AT## market pressure pushed the country off gold in September 1931 .
It wasn ’ t the first time that financial probity had required the real economy to suffer under the Gold Standard .
What was different was that Britain had become a more democratic society : the working class had become unionized , the political franchise had expanded fourfold since the end of World War I , mass media publicized ordinary people ’ s economic plight , and a socialist movement was waiting in the wings .
Despite their own instincts , central bankers and their political masters understood that they could no longer remain aloof from the consequences of economic recession and high unemployment .
Even more importantly , investors understood this , too .
As soon as financial markets begin to question the credibility of a government ’ s commitment to a fixed exchange rate , they become a force for instability .
At the slightest hint of things going awry , investors and depositors pull up stakes and move capital out of the country , thereby precipitating the collapse of the currency .
This movie was replayed in Argentina in the late 1990 ’ s .
The linchpin of Argentina ’ s economic strategy after 1991 was the Convertibility Law , which legally anchored the peso to the US dollar at a one ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## one exchange rate and prohibited restrictions on capital flows .
Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo envisioned the Convertibility Law as both a harness and an engine for the economy .
The strategy worked well initially by bringing much ##AT##-##AT## needed price stability .
But , by the end of the decade , the Argentine nightmare had returned with a vengeance .
The Asian financial crisis and the Brazilian devaluation in early 1999 left the Argentinean peso looking decidedly overvalued .
Doubts about Argentina ’ s ability to service its external debt multiplied , confidence collapsed , and before too long , Argentina ’ s creditworthiness slid below that of some African countries .
Ultimately , what sealed Argentina ’ s fate was not its leaders ’ lack of political will , but rather their inability to impose ever ##AT##-##AT## more costly policies on their domestic constituents .
In fact , the Argentine government was willing to abrogate contracts with virtually all domestic constituencies – public employees , pensioners , provincial governments , and bank depositors – in order to meet its obligations to foreign creditors . &amp; # 160 ;
But investors grew increasingly skeptical that the Argentine congress , provinces , and ordinary people would tolerate the austerity policies needed to continue servicing foreign debt .
As mass protests spread , they were proved right .
When globalization collides with domestic politics , the smart money bets on the home team .
Perhaps there is another path .
Consider Latvia , which recently found itself experiencing economic difficulties similar to those of Argentina a decade ago .
Latvia had grown rapidly since joining the European Union in 2004 , on the back of large ##AT##-##AT## scale external borrowing and a domestic property bubble .
It had run up a current ##AT##-##AT## account deficit and a foreign ##AT##-##AT## debt burden that were literally of Greek proportions .
Predictably , the global financial crisis and abrupt reversal in capital flows in 2008 left the Latvian economy in dire straits .
As lending and property prices collapsed , unemployment rose to 20 % and GDP declined by 18 % in 2009 .
In January 2009 , the country had its worst riots since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Latvia had a fixed exchange rate and free capital flows , just like Argentina .
Its currency has been pegged to the euro since 2005 .
Unlike Argentina , however , the country ’ s politicians managed to tough it out without devaluing the currency and introducing capital controls .
What seems to have changed the balance of political costs and benefits was the prospect of reaching the promised land of eventual membership in the eurozone , which compelled Latvian policymakers to foreclose any options that would endanger that objective .
That , in turn , increased the credibility of their actions – despite those actions ’ very high economic and political costs . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
Will Greece be an Argentina or a Latvia ?
The economics is not encouraging .
Unless the Greek economy recovers , taking on new debt is a temporary palliative that will require even more austerity down the line .
And , as long as domestic demand remains depressed , structural reforms – privatization and liberalization of labor markets and professional services – are unlikely to deliver the needed growth .
As the experiences of interwar Britain – and , more recently , of Argentina and Latvia – show , it is the politics that ultimately determines the outcome .
For the Greek program to have any chance , the Papandreou government must mount a monumental effort to convince its domestic constituents that economic pain is the price they are paying for a brighter future – and not just a means to satisfy external creditors .
WASHINGTON , DC – For generations to come , the Palestinians will remember the horrific war in Gaza with pain and bitterness .
But what cannot yet be seen is how Palestinians will view Hamas .
Whether Hamas can claim a victory – and whether Palestinians will believe them will be determined by the type of ceasefire that is eventually agreed , if a formal one is eventually agreed .
The end game – for both Israel and Hamas – is thus crucially important .
For the moment , Hamas is perceived by the majority of Palestinians as the victim of a war intended to gain its surrender .
After all , Hamas was democratically elected , but was forbidden from ruling and besieged in Gaza .
At the same time , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is accused of siding with Israel in order to restore his lost authority in Gaza .
The war exposed flaws in Hamas ’ judgment .
Hamas apparently did not envision a full ##AT##-##AT## scale confrontation with Israel when it refused to renew a six ##AT##-##AT## month truce .
With Gaza suffering under a lengthy siege , Hamas leader Khalid Mashal said that there was no point in a new truce , since the old one had “ failed to lift the siege on Gaza . ”
Other leaders were quoted as saying that Hamas would “ lift the siege by force . ”
If Hamas is to survive the war , it must demonstrate that its resistance resulted in a permanent opening of Gaza ’ s border crossings , especially in Rafah .
For Palestinians , these are signs of victory .
With open borders , Hamas would secure its regime in Gaza and build its popularity in the West Bank , putting enormous pressure on Abbas , the leader of the rival Fatah movement , to accept a national unity government on terms set by Hamas .
Members of Fatah ’ s Central Committee are already accusing Abbas of supporting Israel in the fighting , of wanting to “ return to Gaza on an Israeli tank . ”
Radical groups within Fatah are leaning toward an open alliance with Hamas .
If Hamas comes out ahead , Abbas ’ s allies in other Palestinian factions will press him to accept Hamas and Islamic Jihad within the PLO .
Egypt will have to backtrack on its rejection of Hamas in order to recover its image among the Arabs and to reduce tensions within Egyptian society .
Pressure to integrate Hamas into Palestinian politics is also likely in some European capitals , particularly Paris and London , where some expressed opposition to isolating Hamas even before the war .
But if Israel forces Hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ceasefire , Hamas ’ s image as the guardian of Palestinian resistance will be severely damaged .
Palestinians will ask if it was really necessary to fight this war and pay such a high price .
Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns , but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation .
One indicator to watch for : the length of that ceasefire .
Palestinians will recognize Hamas ’ s acceptance of a multi ##AT##-##AT## year truce with Israel as a sign of defeat , which would also underscore Palestinian feelings of humiliation and abandonment .
Hezbollah , despite its rhetoric , has taken no steps to support Hamas , and the Arab states seemed more than willing to support its defeat .
It is in rebuilding Gaza that the stakes of the competition will increase .
Abbas , supported by the United States and the European Union , may have control over significant funding .
The test for him will be to deliver quickly .
Hamas will also have resources for reconstruction .
Qatar , a Hamas supporter , has already announced an investment fund for Gaza and contributed $ 250 million .
Hamas will have to make a convincing case that Gaza ’ s near destruction is a price that had to be paid .
Many Palestinians believe that Israel inflicted this damage on Gaza to drive a wedge between the people and the “ resistance . ”
There is a precedent for this argument : Hezbollah described the destruction of Beirut ’ s southern suburbs in exactly these terms at the end of the Lebanon War in July 2006 .
More importantly , Hamas can demonstrate that its leaders have been on the front lines during this war , sharing Palestinian suffering ; many have been killed , along with their families .
The biggest question is whether the war will alter Hamas ’ political goals .
Two weeks ago , Musa Abu Marzouk , a senior Hamas official , praised Jimmy Carter in The Los Angeles Times as the only American president who had brought true peace in the Middle East .
This is a radical departure from Hamas rhetoric , which has always portrayed the Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt as a betrayal of the Islamic world .
It remains to be seen whether Abu Marzouk ’ s view is merely a tactic intended to encourage the Obama administration to reach out to Hamas , or whether the war convinced Hamas that the two ##AT##-##AT## state solution is the only viable option to settle the conflict with Israel .
PARIS &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; Few state visits have lasting results .
Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s just completed trip to Washington may be an exception , because the French President may be preparing to bring NATO a highly valued present for its 60th anniversary in the spring of 2009 : France ’ s return to NATO ’ s integrated military structure , from which Charles de Gaulle withdrew in 1966 .
In retrospect , de Gaulle ’ s decision proved to be much more detrimental for France than for the Alliance .
By withdrawing from NATO ’ s integrated military command , France excluded itself from political decision ##AT##-##AT## making within the Alliance and thus became the equivalent of the “ Harkis ” – the local soldiers who served with the French army during the Algerian war : fine soldiers , but with virtually no reward for their service .
How realistic is the possibility of scenario French return to NATO ’ s military fold ?
Historically , aborted moves and faux pas abound on both sides in the French / NATO relationship , the latest being Jacques Chirac ’ s failed attempt to patch up France ’ s relations with NATO upon his arrival in power in 1995 .
Success is not guaranteed this time , either , but the chances are much higher now , because France , the United States , and the world have changed .
For starters , the US now has a real friend and ally in the Élysée Palace .
To speak of Sarkozy as a substitute for Tony Blair in Europe would be premature – and unhelpful , given Blair ’ s inability to exert significant influence on US policy .
But Sarkozy is both eager to transform France ’ s relations with the Alliance and has a strategy to do so .
Moreover , the French army supports such a move , while only a small segment of the Foreign Ministry is opposed .
Sarkozy ’ s strategy is to link progress in building a common European defense and security structure with a redefinition of NATO .
More Europe in security terms means more Alliance .
So , because Sarkozy wants to be seen as a convinced European , he must normalize France ’ s relations with a new Alliance based on two pillars – European and American .
Moreover , financial and human resources for military affairs are scarce and cannot be duplicated , while France and Britain want to restart the Saint ##AT##-##AT## Malo process of bilateral defense efforts launched nearly ten years ago .
As a result , for the sake of Europe , France must move closer to the Alliance .
Sarkozy has also fully integrated into France ’ s approach to Europe a reckoning with the new balance of power within the European Union following the accession of Eastern European states .
Unlike Chirac , he understands that it is counterproductive and unrealistic to ask countries like Bulgaria or Romania to choose between their European or Atlantic loyalties .
Here , again , strengthening Europe requires strengthening the Alliance .
Sarkozy ’ s approach may work , because America , too , has changed .
In American eyes , the Kosovo war in 1999 demonstrated NATO ’ s glaring and myriad shortcomings , while the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , moved America still further away from the Alliance , particularly after President George W. Bush disparagingly rejected NATO ’ s offer of help .
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld even tried to use divide ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## rule tactics by pitting “ New ” Europe against the “ Old ” Europe led by France and Germany , which opposed the Iraq war .
Those divisions are now history , and American reservations about a European security pillar cannot trump America ’ s pressing needs for allied support .
Confronted with disaster in Iraq , the risk of Afghanistan following Iraq into chaos , and the escalating crisis with Iran , the US can no longer treat the NATO allies with disdain .
Although Europe remains militarily weak , America ’ s power is now in doubt .
If a European pillar within NATO is needed to strengthen the Alliance , why not accept it ?
Beyond the changes in France and the US , the decisive factor behind the possible reinvention of NATO is the transformation of the international system itself .
Aside from the explosive situation in the Middle East and the threat of Islamist terrorism , the West is now confronted with the rise of Asia , the return of a more assertive Russia , and new energy and environmental challenges .
Both France and America have a key role to play in addressing these issues effectively .
Sarkozy ’ s trip to Washington , and his address to a receptive US Congress , was one more step toward ensuring that they do so together .
CHICAGO – Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff , in their excellent , eponymous book on debt crises , argue that the most dangerous words in any language are “ This time is different . ” Perhaps the next most dangerous words are “ Next time will be different . ”
These words are often uttered when politicians and central banks want to bail out some troubled segment of the economy . “ Yes , ” one can almost hear them saying , “ we understand that bailing out banks will subvert market discipline .
But you cannot expect us to stand by and watch the system collapse , causing millions of innocent people to suffer .
We have to live with the hand we are dealt .
But next time will be different . ” They then use every tool they have to prevent economic losses on their watch .
The government ’ s incentives are clear .
The public rewards them for dealing with the problem at hand – whether building levees to protect houses built on a flood plain or rescuing banks that have dodgy securities on their balance sheets .
Politicians and central bankers gain little by letting the greedy or careless face the full consequences of their actions , for many innocent people would suffer as well .
A sympathetic press would amplify their heart ##AT##-##AT## rending stories of lost jobs and homes , making those counseling against intervention appear callous .
Democracies are necessarily soft ##AT##-##AT## hearted , whereas markets and nature are not ; government inevitably expands to fill the gap .
To the extent that the rough justice meted out by markets or nature teaches anyone to behave better , it has consequences far beyond the horizon of anyone in power today .
When asked to choose between the risk of being known to posterity as the central banker who let the system collapse and the intangible future benefits of teaching risk takers a lesson , it does not take genius to predict the central banker ’ s decision .
Democracy tends to institutionalize moral hazard in sectors that are economically or politically important , such as finance or real estate , allowing them to privatize gains and socialize losses .
Even though the authorities insist that the next time will be different , everyone knows that they will make the same decision when confronted with the same choice again .
So , knowing that next time will not be different , the authorities try their best to prevent a “ next time . ”
But risk takers have every incentive to try their luck again , knowing that , at worst , they will be bailed out .
In this cat ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## mouse game , risk takers have the upper hand .
For one thing , risk takers are typically small , cohesive interest groups that , once rescued , have a powerful incentive , as well as the resources , to buy the political influence needed to ensure a return to the status quo ante .
If risk takers were allowed to face more serious losses , they would have fewer resources to fight political attempts to constrain their risky activities .
Moreover , the public does not have a long memory , a long time horizon , or an appetite for detail .
Even as the United States ’ voluminous Dodd ##AT##-##AT## Frank bill tried to ensure that bankers never subjected American taxpayers to undue risk again , public attention had moved on to the state of the real economy and unemployment .
Why focus on financial regulation when the risks of an immediate collapse are small , and when the details are so tedious ?
As technical experts and lobbyists took over , and the public lost interest , Dodd ##AT##-##AT## Frank became friendlier and friendlier to the banks .
So how can this one ##AT##-##AT## way betting be stopped ?
The scary answer may be that it does not end until governments run out of money ( as in Ireland ) or the public runs out of sympathy ( as in Germany vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis the rest of Europe ) .
To avoid that fate , governments should start by recognizing that the system is programmed to respond to deep distress , and that they can do nothing about it .
But they must try to ensure that they do not destroy incentives by doing too much .
And they must offset the distortions created by intervention in other ways .
For example , the US Federal Reserve has essentially guaranteed the financial sector that if it gets into trouble , ultra ##AT##-##AT## low interest rates will be maintained ( at the expense of savers ) until the sector recovers .
In the early to mid ##AT##-##AT## 1990 ’ s , rates were kept low because of banks ’ real ##AT##-##AT## estate problems .
They were slashed again in 2001 and kept ultra ##AT##-##AT## low after the dot ##AT##-##AT## com bust .
And they have been ultra ##AT##-##AT## low since 2008 .
Senior Fed policymakers deny that their interest ##AT##-##AT## rate policy bears any responsibility for risk taking , but there is much evidence to the contrary .
It would be difficult for the Fed to respond differently if the financial sector gets into trouble again .
But it does not have to maintain ultra ##AT##-##AT## low interest rates after the crisis has passed , especially if those rates have little impact on generating sustainable economic activity .
Doing so merely rewards banks for their past excesses – and taxes savers .
More importantly , if the Fed wants to restore incentives for risk takers and savers , it should offset the effects of staying “ low for long ” in bad times by increasing interest rates more rapidly than is strictly necessary as the economy recovers .
This will , of course , be politically difficult , because the public has been programmed to think that ultra ##AT##-##AT## low rates are good , and higher rates bad , for growth , without any consideration for the long ##AT##-##AT## term sustainability of growth .
Finally , the pressure on governments to intervene would be lower if individuals had access to a minimum safety net .
Official US policy is so activist in downturns ( regardless of its effectiveness ) partly because unemployment is so costly to workers – who have little savings , unemployment benefits that run out quickly , and health care that is often tied to a job .
A stronger safety net for individuals might allow politicians to accept more corporate or financial ##AT##-##AT## sector distress , and help bolster their claim that next time really will be different .
After Israel ’ s inability last summer to achieve a conclusive victory over Hezbollah in southern Lebanon , public pressure forced Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’ s government to appoint a commission to examine the causes of this surprising failure .
How could a small militia , numbering less than a few thousand combatants , survive the onslaught of the Middle East ’ s most formidable military machine ?
The commission , headed by retired Supreme Court judge Eliyahu Winograd , has just published its interim report .
Its criticism of Olmert , Defense Minister Amir Peretz , and Chief ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## Staff Dan Halutz – set forth in a detailed and meticulous 117 ##AT##-##AT## page assessment – is harsh , but not surprising .
The Winograd Commission articulated what most Israelis already think : Olmert and Peretz lacked the military , security , and policy experience to confront a terrorist organization that raided Israeli territory , killed a number of soldiers and kidnapped two , and then launched thousands of rockets on civilian targets for over a month .
Indeed , the inexperience of the prime minister and the defense minister are unprecedented in Israel ’ s history .
Olmert , who stepped into Ariel Sharon ’ s shoes as leader of the new Kadima Party , was considered a competent but lackluster parliamentarian – and later mayor of Jerusalem – who was known more for his polemical style than for his political stature or gravitas .
For most Israelis , even those who voted for him as the bearer of Sharon ’ s legacy after the Gaza disengagement , Olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister .
Likewise , Peretz , a rabble ##AT##-##AT## rousing but effective trade unionist , surprised all when he won the Labor Party ’ s leadership primary and then chose the defense portfolio over the treasury .
To many , the duo of Olmert and Peretz seemed to invite trouble .
Precisely because Israelis are aware of the constant security threat facing their country , they have always believed that their leaders should be able to lead Israel in war – but also to ask the military tough questions when diplomacy may fail .
When such a moment arrived , totally out of the blue ( or so it seemed ) with Hezbollah ’ s raid on July 12 , 2006 , Israel ’ s two top politicians were completely out of their depth , stumbling into a war for which neither they nor the Israeli Army were prepared .
The military was led – for the first time in its history – by an Air Force general , Dan Halutz , who believed that everything could be solved by air power , creating a combustible combination of civilian ignorance and military arrogance .
In measured but devastating prose , the Winograd Commission gives failing marks to all three leaders .
Olmert decided to go into battle recklessly and unaware of the consequences .
Peretz was unable to gauge the strategic implications of his decisions .
And Halutz failed to present the civilian leadership with the full panoply of military options at the army ’ s disposal .
Halutz already resigned a few months ago .
But both Olmert and Peretz have declared that , despite the Commission ’ s conclusions , they would not quit : instead , they have vowed to implement the report ’ s many far ##AT##-##AT## reaching substantive recommendations about policy , strategy , and decision ##AT##-##AT## making processes .
Will Olmert and Peretz be able to stay on ?
Their coalition government enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority ; nor does the political arithmetic imply a viable parliamentary alternative .
But public opinion – volatile and angry – calls for both to resign : a public ##AT##-##AT## opinion poll conducted after the Commission published its report indicated that only 14 % of Israelis believe that Olmert should keep his job , while less than 11 % support Peretz .
Later this week , demonstrations calling for the government &apos;s resignation are planned , and it will become obviously more difficult for the government to continue to function .
There are already rumors about a palace coup within Kadima , aimed at replacing Olmert with either the deputy prime minister , the veteran Shimon Peres , or the popular foreign minister , Tzipi Livni .
But it does not appear that Olmert will allow himself to be pushed out .
In fact , Olmert ’ s weak and discredited government may yet survive .
If the government were to fall and new elections held , there are strong indications that the winner might be Binyamin Netanyahu , of the right ##AT##-##AT## wing Likud , which was decimated in the 2006 elections , but is now patiently waiting in the wings .
Many who want Olmert to go would still not welcome a Netanyahu comeback , which may also explain what appears to be an indirect endorsement of Olmert by the United States .
Only a strong Israeli government can make the painful decisions necessary for negotiations with the Palestinians to succeed .
As a result , the prospects for meaningful continuation of Israeli ##AT##-##AT## Palestinian talks look even dimmer than they did before .
Indeed , the real loser of the 2006 Lebanon war was neither Israel nor Hezbollah , but , at least for the time being , the peace process .
Interest rates around the world are poised to rise .
Short ##AT##-##AT## term rates have gone so low since the worldwide recession of 2001 - 1 % and 2 % , respectively , in the United States and the Eurozone , and practically zero in Japan - that a strengthening world economy will force central banks to tighten the monetary reins .
Australia &apos;s central bank has already been raising rates since May 2002 , and Great Britain &apos;s since November 2003 .
In the US , the two ##AT##-##AT## day Federal Open Market Committee meeting on June 29 ##AT##-##AT## 30 is likely to mark a major turning point , reversing the steady decline of the benchmark federal funds rate since Alan Greenspan began loosening monetary policy in 2001 .
This is likely to be followed by rate increases in China , the Eurozone , and elsewhere .
Given the tendency of central banks to change interest rates gradually , any change of direction likely means more changes in the same direction later .
What will this landmark change mean for prices of such assets as stocks and homes ?
In theory , when interest rates go up , there is reason to believe that asset prices will go down .
The higher interest rates go , the better are investments in bonds , which compete with investments in other assets such as stocks or homes .
Higher interest rates also raise the cost of borrowing to buy these assets , which may diminish demand for them , exerting downward pressure on their prices .
When interest rates fall , the opposite effect on asset prices may be predicted .
In fact , the history of the stock market &apos;s reactions to changing interest rates is mixed .
Sometimes interest rate changes have the predicted effect , sometimes they don &apos;t .
For example , the NASDAQ stock price index made a spectacular 14 % jump upwards on the day ( January 3 , 2001 ) when America &apos;s Fed began its latest series of interest rate cuts . A jump in the market is what one might have expected .
But then the NASDAQ index fell 22 % over the following year , although the Fed continued to cut interest rates aggressively .
Does that experience suggest that the NASDAQ index will drop sharply if the Fed raises interest rates on June 30 ?
No .
The timing of the 2001 rate decrease stunned the market .
By contrast , the Fed is widely expected to raise rates at the end this month , so there will be no surprise element .
The market may know , not just from the experience of 2001 ##AT##-##AT## 2 , that interest rate movements do not have predictable effects on stock prices .
But , there are reasons to believe that higher interest rates , even though expected , can have a negative impact on home prices .
That is because home buyers are mostly ordinary people with little financial sophistication , unlike the professionals who trade in stocks .
Untrained people with other things on their minds can make serious economic errors .
Home values have soared to high levels in many countries as irrational exuberance grips the markets .
High home prices are already putting great stress on many families , which are struggling to make their mortgage payments .
When interest rates go up , these payments will ( when the rate is variable ) also go up , possibly becoming unsustainable .
If one borrows the equivalent of three years &apos; income to buy a house , a mortgage rate of 6 % means that 18 % of one &apos;s income goes to interest payments , which may be tolerable .
But if the rate rises to 8 % , mortgage interest payments rise to 24 % , which , together with amortization , taxes , other debts , and necessary expenditures , may claim too much of the family budget .
Some will then try to sell their overpriced homes , and the resulting market imbalance will cause prices to fall .
People with fixed ##AT##-##AT## rate mortgages are also vulnerable to rate increases , though less directly .
This is because if they have to move and sell their house , there may be no buyers who can afford higher interest payments , unless the home &apos;s price also falls .
By contrast , sophisticated investors , such as big stock market players , are unlikely to fall prey to this trap .
But homebuyers are not as savvy , so they may not see the change coming or they may fail to plan for it .
As psychologists have shown , people are susceptible to &quot; wishful thinking bias , &quot; wishing away possible future problems that they would rather not think about .
They may overemphasize the likelihood of economic success ( &quot; I will be making a lot more money in a few years &quot; ) and underemphasize the commonplace problems that regularly challenge family budgets ( &quot; I will be losing my job or getting a divorce &quot; ) .
This blithe attitude is ultimately behind real estate bubbles where they are occurring .
Low interest rates did not cause the bubbles . They only made it easier for people , in those areas of the world where there is a half ##AT##-##AT## believable story about a fabulous future economy , to indulge their fantasies .
Interest rate increases will deliver a fresh dose of reality : the interest expense of owning a home is going to claim a larger share of family budgets , a hard fact that will eventually sink into our thinking .
But declines in home prices will not occur quickly when central banks begin to raise interest rates .
After two years of rate increases , Australia &apos;s home price boom only recently shows signs of abating .
Dominated by amateur investors , home markets do not turn on a dime .
In places where home prices have been rising rapidly , the upward trend may continue or level off for a while .
In most high ##AT##-##AT## priced places , a real decline may not come for some time .
MOSCOW – Rapid changes in the global economy and international politics are raising , once more , an eternal issue in Russia : the country ’ s relations with Europe , and with the Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic region as a whole . Of course , Russia partly belongs to this region .
It is becoming obvious that the Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic world , whose economic and political model seemed so triumphant 20 years ago , is now lagging somewhat behind China and other Asian countries . So is Russia , where , despite encouraging talk about innovation ##AT##-##AT## based development , the economy continues to de ##AT##-##AT## modernize as corruption has been allowed to metastasize , and as the country relies increasingly on its natural ##AT##-##AT## resource wealth .
These rising powers raise problems regarding Russia ’ s geo ##AT##-##AT## strategic choices.For the first time in decades , the values gap between Russia and the EU appears to be increasing . Europe is overcoming state nationalism , while Russia is building a nation state.Broken by history and not wishing to be ravaged by war again , Europeans have embraced compromise and renounced the direct use of force in international relations .
Russians , on the other hand , emphasize their “ hard power , ” includingmilitary force , because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind . And , because of the country ’ s comparative lack of “ soft power ” – social , cultural , and economic attractiveness – it stands ready touse the competitive advantages ( i.e. , its resource wealth ) available to it .
Internal political developments in Russia are also pushing the country in a different direction from the West . Quite simply , Russia is moving away from democracy .
NATO expansion is nothing more than the extension of its zone of influence – andin the most sensitive , military ##AT##-##AT## political sphere . And yet the West ’ sunwillingness to abandon that effort is coupled with a repeated refusal to recognize Russia ’ s right to have its own zone of interest .
So NATO expansion has left the Cold War unfinished . The ideological and military confrontation that underlay it is gone , but the geopolitical rivalry that it entailed has returned to the fore .
Non ##AT##-##AT## Russian Europe should thank the Almighty for the presence of energy ##AT##-##AT## rich Russia at its borders , while Russia should be thankful for having such wealthy customers . But the natural differences in the interests of energy consumers and producers have been given a political / security twist – witness the discussions about an “ Energy NATO . ”
Faced with the impossibility of advantageous accession to Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic institutions , Russia is drifting fast towards alignment with China – a “ younger brother , ” though a respected one . Russia ’ s “ Asian choice ” of today is not the same as the Slavophile / Eurasian choice of the past .
The United States also loses . Without Russia , which will remain the world ’ s third strongest power for the foreseeable future , it is impossible to solve the key problems of international security .
The current Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic security architecture seems to suit the majority of Americans and Europeans , though it is becoming increasingly fragile and counterproductive.So Russia will struggle to create a new architecture largely on its own – whether through a new treaty on collective European security , or even through its accession to NATO . This is not only in Russian political and civilizational interest , but it also reflects our duty to the entire community of Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic nations , which is being weakened by the “ unfinished Cold War . ”
That Union should be based on a common human , economic , and energy space . The combination of a new security arrangement for the Euro ##AT##-##AT## Atlantic community and the establishment of the Union of Europe could arrest the decline in the international weight of the West .
RIO DE JANEIRO – Brazil has been making international headlines of late , but not for traditional stories about urban violence , natural catastrophes , political corruption , or deforestation in the Amazon .
At the G ##AT##-##AT## 20 Summit in London last April , for example , US President Barack Obama called for the world to pay heed to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , the “ most popular politician on earth , ” and shook hands with him , saying : “ My man right here .
I love this guy . ”
In September , the ousted president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , reappeared in the country inside the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa after three months of exile .
Although his presence dramatically fuelled the situation for a time , Brazilian diplomats , working with the US , were able to reach agreement with Honduran authorities to allow Manuel Zelaya to return to office .
Then came the news that Brazil will host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games – this coming on top of hosting the 2014 World Cup .
As for the global – and fortunately now abating – economic crisis , Brazil has shined throughout , recording a fast and strong recovery . And , as if this good news were not enough , Brazil ’ s giant state oil company , Petrobrás , is already at work developing two huge deep ##AT##-##AT## water oil fields discovered in the sea off the coast of Rio de Janeiro .
For these and other reasons , Brazil is gaining the world ’ s attention .
Brazilian democracy , at long last , is working well , following many years of military government , and its economy seems more robust than ever .
As a result , many people are enthusiastically pointing to an increased international role for Brazil in the future .
But two connected and major challenges lie ahead for Brazil and its government : the need to build a far more equal society and to resist the temptation to use nationalism to mask whatever domestic failures may manifest themselves .
Brazil ’ s current success is rooted not only in Lula ’ s two terms , which must end in 2010 .
The economic stabilization program enacted by Fernando Henrique Cardoso since 1994 ( the Real Plan ) , first as finance minister and then as president for two terms , solidified a structure that made it possible for Lula ’ s tenure to be so prosperous .
This is not meant to take anything away from Lula .
His presidency has guaranteed political stability and strengthened social cohesion .
Indeed , by managing the political process to make the government work for Brazil ’ s people , Lula ’ s administration has made Brazil a truly stable and consensual democracy .
There is nothing modest about that achievement , given Brazil ’ s traditional institutional instability and the series of major corruption scandals that engulfed Lula ’ s government in 2005 and 2006 .
Lula survived those scandals and did not move to amend the constitution in order to seek a third term , though some in Brazil pressed him to do so .
Lula also enacted critically important social policies .
Under his government , two million homes received electric power for the first time , 11 million very poor families gained the support of a minimum income ( the Bolsa Família ) , the minimum salary grew 45 % in real terms , thus benefiting 42 million people .
Moreover , eight million jobs were created , 17 million people escaped poverty , and the income of the poorest 50 % grew 32 % – twice as fast as the income of the richest 10 % in the same period .
And Lula achieved all this without triggering inflation , which he knows – perhaps a result of his own impoverished childhood – wreaks havoc on the poor most of all .
This vast transformation has not only generated a virtuous circle that strengthened institutional stability and social capital .
It has also differentiated Brazil from other countries in Latin America , putting the country in the forefront in the region in terms of dealing with traditional social and economic injustices in a democratic way .
Yet the remaining challenges are huge , for Brazil remains the seventh most unequal society in the world – and severe violence persists .
Sixty ##AT##-##AT## four percent of Brazilian homes lack electricity and sanitation , and only 22 % have electricity , a telephone , a computer , a refrigerator , a television , and a washing machine .
In the poorest region , the North and Northeast , the numbers fall to 8.6 % and 8.3 % .
Among the young , almost 37 % of 18 ##AT##-##AT## 24 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## olds do not finish high school .
Only half the population over age 25 has more than eight years of formal education .
As for Brazil ’ s international role , a subtle competition is emerging with the US .
America wants to conclude as many free ##AT##-##AT## trade agreements in the region as it can , while Brazil favors expanding its custom union , Mercosul / Mercosur .
The entrance of Venezuela into the Brazilian bloc , Brazilian leadership at the United Nations mission in Haiti , and Brazil ’ s role in the Honduran affair are all part of this emerging competition .
If Brazil is to remain on its prosperous path , it must continue to give higher priority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adventures .
The construction of a major egalitarian , free , and democratic society that respects and works with the international institutions is the best thing that Brazil can give to the world right now .
ISTANBUL – Will the recent rapprochement between the United States and Syria mark a new era in Syria ’ s international standing ?
Syria can hope for two major changes following the restoration of full diplomatic relations with the US .
First , it will be removed from America ’ s informal blacklist of “ Axis of Evil ” countries , which will substantially improve its chances to enter the World Trade Organization .
Second , Syria will probably receive the go ##AT##-##AT## ahead for a pipeline to bring Iraqi oil across its territory to Turkey .
Such a link to Turkey ’ s economy – and thus possibly to the European Union – would encourage Syria to open its economy even more to foreign investment .
But all of this will undoubtedly come at a price .
Syria ’ s side of the bargain will invariably need to be an end to its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon , for which it will likely seek the return of the Golan Heights .
Israel would presumably resist this outcome , and Iran – as leader of the so ##AT##-##AT## called “ Shia crescent ” spreading from Lebanon to Tajikistan – would strongly , and perhaps violently , oppose such a bargain as well .
During Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’ s visit to Syria earlier this year , Syria ’ s President Bashar Assad and he reiterated their unyielding cooperation in the face of “ Western manipulations . ”
But Assad is under growing pressure from the ranks of his Baath Party to modernize the country and its infrastructure , which is impossible without improved ties to the West .
Syria ’ s economy is a rust pile .
With a per capita income of $ 2,000 , it has been closed to the outside world until recently .
Rationing is pervasive .
But , in order to secure public support , Assad ’ s government has allowed for greater domestic consumption , so foreign imports are rising fast .
Indeed , the country has run a trade deficit since 2005 , with no path back to balance in sight .
Supposedly “ friendly ” countries like Iran have been giving a helping hand , but almost always in the form of oil – and not even refined oil – rather than cash .
The effort to liberalize foreign investment has not taken up the slack in investment from the regime ’ s regional political partners .
For example , the Foreign Investment Law of 2007 , which fixed a 15 ##AT##-##AT## day deadline for projects to be authorized , has resulted in only $ 200 million in new inward investment .
This lack of investment has left the economy , particularly the oil industry , in a shambles .
A member of OPEC , Syria is now a net importer of oil .
The ruling Shia elite that surrounds President Assad – and that , together with the military oligarchy , retains almost total control of the economy – appears to be interested mainly in preserving the stagnant status quo .
In opposition stand Syria ’ s Sunni traders , who are joined in demanding a change in the rules of the game by the country ’ s various minorities , composed of two million Christians , 1.7 million Kurds , and 400,000 Druze .
The combined economic weight of the Christians – Nestorians , Maronites , Catholic Greeks , and Syriacs – is greater than their actual number , and the Bathist regime has always sought to accommodate these minorities .
But it was only with the accession to power of Bashir al Assad that they were given more economic and political breathing space .
Assad has good reason to do so , because the unequal distribution of wealth , combined with an official unemployment rate of 15 % , is fueling social pressure .
The $ 3 fare for a bus ride between Aleppo and Damascus might look cheap to someone from outside Syria , but , given that a well ##AT##-##AT## trained technician may earn only $ 150 monthly , it is almost prohibitively expensive .
A warming of relations with the US could set in play two types of dynamics : one originates with the OECD ’ s development initiative for the Middle East and North Africa ( MENA ) , created in 2004 .
For the first time , the OECD became directly involved with non ##AT##-##AT## member countries in the Middle East , and in 2009 Syria was included in its development cooperation master plan .
The second positive dynamic may come from improved Turkish ##AT##-##AT## Syrian economic ties .
Bilateral relations started to thaw 12 years ago , when Syria expelled the leader of the violent Kurdish separatist PKK movement , Abdullah Ocalan .
A Turkish ##AT##-##AT## Syrian Business Council was established soon after with the hope of developing economic relations , but little impact has been felt , owing to Turkey ’ s lingering suspicion of Syria ’ s political alignment .
The only Turkish investment was made in the textile field by the firm Akteks .
Last year , however , as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan pushed forward on strengthening Turkey ’ s Middle Eastern ties , visa requirements between the two countries were eased , with cross ##AT##-##AT## border car traffic increasing 22 % in five months .
Regular bus lines have been opened , and , according to a high ##AT##-##AT## ranking Turkish bank official , “ We were hesitating about opening a branch in Syria because of the US embargo , so the sending of an envoy is like a green light to us . ”
For Syria , the choice now is between seizing this opportunity to open its economy , or retreating back into its Baathist shell . The benefits of such an opening are clear .
The question is whether Syria ’ s rulers can make the political choices necessary to obtain them .
Unless inflation drops much more , now is an ideal time to be a borrower and a bad time to be a lender or investor in long ##AT##-##AT## term bonds .
Indeed , in many countries , exaggerated fears of deflation are keeping interest rates depressed and the cost of capital at historic lows .
The lowest rates were seen on June 13 th .
Ten ##AT##-##AT## year bonds in the US yielded 3.11 % , not much above the 2.1 % inflation rate of the past 12 months .
Ten ##AT##-##AT## year government bonds in the Euro ##AT##-##AT## area yielded 3.54 % , while the Euro ##AT##-##AT## area inflation rate was 1.9 % .
The yield in the UK was 3.86 % , while inflation was 3 % , and Japanese bonds yielded 0.44 % , compared with inflation of -0.1 % .
In each case , a small increase in today &apos;s very low inflation rates would eliminate any real gain from investing in bonds .
If low long ##AT##-##AT## term rates do not hold , long ##AT##-##AT## term bond prices will drop sharply , leaving investors with a loss .
The history of developed ##AT##-##AT## country bond markets in the last half ##AT##-##AT## century is relatively straightforward .
Consumer inflation increased fairly steadily ( albeit with major short ##AT##-##AT## run swings ) , until the oil crises of 1973 ##AT##-##AT## 4 and 1979 ##AT##-##AT## 81 propelled it to historic highs in Europe , North America , Japan and other countries .
Afterwards , the trend was reversed , and inflation declined fairly steadily .
The oil crises marked a political as well as an economic turning point .
Until that time , central banks , fearing recession , were gradually losing their grip on inflation .
But public anger over sky ##AT##-##AT## high price growth precipitated by the oil crises finally allowed central banks to tighten credit and smother inflation with massive global recessions .
Corporate managers , meanwhile , got the public support needed to resist many cost ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## living allowances that were fueling a wage ##AT##-##AT## price spiral .
The general investing public never really understood these trends .
They did not comprehend the upward trend in prices before 1980 , so bond yields , lagging behind rising inflation , were too low .
In the US , ten ##AT##-##AT## year US Treasury yields averaged only 1.46 % above the inflation rate between 1953 , when annual average inflation was only 0.63 % , and March 1980 , when inflation peaked at 14.66 % .
Nor did the investing public fully comprehend the downtrend in inflation after 1980 , so long ##AT##-##AT## term bond yields , lagging behind falling inflation , were too high .
In the US , yields on ten ##AT##-##AT## year Treasuries have averaged 4.14 % above the rate of inflation throughout the period of declining inflation that began in April 1980 .
The public &apos;s failure to recognize inflation trends meant that long ##AT##-##AT## term bonds were a terrible investment until 1980 , when inflation was only a little lower than yields , and a lucrative investment thereafter , when declining inflation and high yields guaranteed large real gains .
Investors are again making the mistake of pricing bonds in expectation that the downward trend of inflation will continue into deflationary territory .
Indeed , today &apos;s low long ##AT##-##AT## term rates suggest that investors are projecting the downward trend to continue over the next ten years at the same pace that it has done since 1980 , implying that the current US inflation rate of 2.1 % would fall to zero or below by 2013 .
Is this reasonable ?
Almost certainly not .
No central bank would permit deflation for long , and the current level of inflation probably represents the lower boundary that most monetary authorities consider acceptable .
At the same time , there is no such clear upper bound to inflation .
So with inflation rates near their long ##AT##-##AT## term lower bound , the expectation should be for higher , not lower , inflation rates over the longer term .
The current situation in the bond markets does not reflect this because of public overreaction to the talk of deflation , with Japan used as a scarecrow .
But even in Japan , annual deflation has been only about 0.7 % since 1998 , and was caused by a monetary ##AT##-##AT## policy error unlikely to be repeated .
Japan is really the only example of advanced ##AT##-##AT## country deflation in the post ##AT##-##AT## 1945 era .
So why should bad policy by the Bank of Japan set the trend for world inflation rates ?
Indeed , the opposite may be the case : combating deflation could have the perverse effect of creating high inflation .
This is what Masuru Hayami , the former governor of the Bank of Japan , feared when he resisted calls for more monetary stimulus .
He was right to worry : a sharply expanding money supply may have unexpected and unquantifiable lagged effects .
The kinds of heterodox monetary policy that might be used to prevent deflation similarly risk an overreaction and renewed inflation .
But fear of deflation is so widespread nowadays that if inflation overshoots the target , central banks will merely try to stop further inflation , rather than try to bring the consumer price level back down which would mean deflation .
Then any inflationary monetary policy errors driven by exaggerated fears of deflation will be allowed to stand , and the cumulative inflation will offset any returns on investments in long ##AT##-##AT## term bonds .
Today &apos;s fears about deflation may represent a historic turning point , much as when the public mood turned decisively against inflation around 1980 .
Conventional wisdom has changed , and many people will be breathing a sigh of relief when inflation rates rise above 3 % or more in the US and elsewhere .
If we have arrived at such a turning point , as the trend in bond markets in recent weeks might suggest , it will be a turning point for interest rates and bond prices as well .
The current combination of exceptionally low yields and high prices suggests that much of the world is in a bond ##AT##-##AT## market bubble , and when it bursts in coming years , a period of higher long ##AT##-##AT## term interest rates and lower long ##AT##-##AT## term bond prices will follow .
EMBARGO 6 SEPTEMBER 2004
More than forty years ago , Turkey applied for associate membership of the European Economic Community .
With the Association agreement of 1963 , a special relationship was established , culminating in the customs union of 1996 .
During all these years , European governments consistently confirmed Turkey &apos;s eligibility for full membership , making accession dependent on compliance with membership criteria .
Turkey &apos;s formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights , including abolition of the death penalty , safeguards against torture , promotion of religious freedoms , gender equality , and restriction of the military &apos;s role in political life .
Should the EU consider the accession criteria as having been fulfilled , it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005 .
Not to do so would mean to renege on political commitments and to severely damage the EU &apos;s credibility in the world .
In many parts of Europe , however , Turkey &apos;s admission to the EU is viewed with skepticism owing to its size , relatively poor economy , fears of massive immigration , and , above all , cultural and societal differences - a euphemism for Islam .
It would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges .
However , they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable .
Negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015 .
This period of time would offer both Turkey and the Union an opportunity to come to terms .
With 80 million people , Turkey would be one of the largest EU states .
But the size of a country plays only a limited role in the EU &apos;s decision ##AT##-##AT## making process , because political influence within the Union depends more on economic power .
Moreover , for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions , and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU .
Because of its weak economy , Turkey would be eligible for substantial EU assistance .
The size of these transfers , however , would depend on the EU &apos;s financial policies at the time of admission , the outcome of accession negotiations , and economic developments in Turkey .
In any case , the EU &apos;s practice of &quot; capping &quot; its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by Turkey &apos;s accession .
Immigration should not be a cause for undue concern , either .
Human mobility is limited , and Turkey workers &apos; would probably be allowed to move freely within the EU only after a long transition period , possibly not before 2025 .
Given the expected upswing of Turkey &apos;s economy and its declining birthrate , experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point .
Meanwhile , diminishing and aging populations in most of Europe will have made immigration a necessity .
Among the countries from where immigration to the EU is probable , Turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation .
It is Turkey &apos;s Muslim population that creates the strongest emotions .
Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture .
It is also feared that Islamists may one day turn Turkey into a fundamentalist state .
Unlikely as it may be in view of Turkey &apos;s deeply rooted secularism , such a risk cannot be totally excluded .
But the same is true for any other democracy , where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes .
Surely , the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen Turkey &apos;s democratic system , which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries .
As for the EU , it must decide whether it wants to be a closed &quot; Christian club &quot; or an open and inclusive society , drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity .
Turkey &apos;s accession to the Union would give a powerful answer , one that would be heard with particular clarity in the Islamic world .
The need to refute arguments against Turkey &apos;s admission to the EU leaves the advantages rarely mentioned : its unique geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans , Southern Caucasus , Central Asia , and the Middle East - vitally important regions for Europe &apos;s security ; its role as mayor transit country for energy supplies ; its military capabilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European Defense Policy ; and the great potential of the Turkish economy , with its young and dynamic labor force .
At the same time , the risks of rejecting Turkey must also be taken into account : the likelihood that the reform process would collapse , bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the EU &apos;s doorsteps .
Turkish EU membership presents both opportunities and challenges .
On balance , however , the advantages far outweigh the risks .
Much of America ’ s dominance in world finance comes from the dollar ’ s status as international money .
America ’ s commitment to free capital markets , the rule of law , and price stability confer credibility on the dollar as a store of value .
But American spending habits have undermined the dollar ’ s reputation , with the excess supply of dollars on world markets depressing its price .
This spring , the euro ’ s exchange rate against the dollar reached an all ##AT##-##AT## time high , and central banks have increased the euro share of their international reserves .
Is the dollar about to lose the crown of world finance to the euro ?
History suggests otherwise , despite a vulnerable dollar .
American financial supremacy in the twenty ##AT##-##AT## first century resembles Britain ’ s position in world finance a century ago .
Before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the pound sterling served as the currency of choice for international transactions , just as the dollar does today , and the world ’ s borrowers visited the City of London to raise capital .
The British economist John Maynard Keynes worried that countries would not use sterling to settle trading balances with each other if the pound were not viewed as a reliable store of value .
The “ future position of the City of London , ” according to Keynes , depended on the pound sterling continuing to serve the business world as the equivalent of gold .
Britain maintained the pound ’ s convertibility into gold at the outbreak of the Great War to preserve its credibility as the international medium of exchange .
The dollar could not challenge sterling ’ s role as the world ’ s currency without matching its reputation .
August 1914 provided the opportunity .
The biggest gold outflow in a generation imperiled America ’ s ability to repay its debts abroad .
Fear that the US would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plummeting on world markets .
But Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo secured American financial honor in August 1914 by remaining true to gold while everyone else , except for the British , abandoned their obligations .
Despite the dollar ’ s instant credibility , however , it took more than a decade for America ’ s currency to match Britain ’ s as an international medium of exchange .
Payment habits melt at a glacier ’ s pace .
Britain ’ s transformation from international creditor to international debtor during the Great War gave the dollar a second wind in its battle with sterling .
The British were forced to abandon gold convertibility in April 1919 – a tactical withdrawal intended to pave the way for Britain ’ s return to the former $ 4.8665 parity with the American dollar .
Six years later , in April 1925 , Britain confirmed its monetary credibility and returned to the gold standard .
But the pound had already suffered irreparable damage .
The experience of 1914 implies that a credible alternative can replace an entrenched world currency , especially after an unfavorable balance of trade has weakened it .
But even then , dethroning the reigning king of international exchange takes time .
Today , the euro – a currency without a country – lacks a long track record of credibility .
Thirteen countries in the European Union use the euro as money .
But the commitment of these independent political entities to the euro cannot match the history of America ’ s commitment to the dollar .
The European Central Bank , established in 1998 , has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability .
But the ECB needs time to establish its inflation ##AT##-##AT## fighting credentials .
It cannot hitch a ride on gold , the way America did a century ago .
So the euro must earn its reputation crisis by crisis to confront the dollar ’ s dominance as the currency of choice for international transactions .
Recent experience with the euro as an official reserve asset is instructive .
Between 2000 and 2005 , the dollar lost more than 25 % of its value against the euro .
Meanwhile , the fraction of international reserves held in euros grew from 18 % to 24 % , and the dollar ’ s share dropped from 71 % to 66 % .
In short , the euro has clearly made some headway during this period of US balance of payment deficits , but this reflects an evolutionary decline in the dollar ’ s dominance , not a revolutionary regime shift .
What might trigger a fatal run on the dollar in world markets ?
While a broad and abrupt sell ##AT##-##AT## off by major foreign holders of dollars – for example , China – appears unlikely , a cataclysmic event , similar to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914 , could prompt a search for a new international medium of exchange .
In the modern era of automated payments , the upheaval might come from a terrorist attack that undermines the computerized transfer facilities of the world ’ s banking system .
A catastrophic loss of electronic records could surely destroy the credibility of the dollar as the international medium of exchange .
But exactly what would replace the dollar under such circumstances remains an open question .
After all , a loss of computer records would make the euro equally suspect .
Perhaps gold , a store of value impervious to physical distortion , could make a comeback .
Of course , one can only hope that such a scenario remains pure conjecture .
CAMBRIDGE – The European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) and the euro are about to celebrate their tenth anniversary .
The euro was introduced without serious problems and has since functioned well , with the European Central Bank delivering the low inflation that is its sole mandate .
But the current economic crisis may provide a severe test of the euro ’ s ability to survive in more troubled times .
While the crisis could strengthen the institutions provided by the EMU , it could also create multiple risks , of which member countries need to be aware if they want to avoid them .
The primary problem is that conditions in individual EMU members may develop in such different ways that some national political leaders could be tempted to conclude that their countries would be better served by adopting a mix of policies different from that of the other members .
The current differences in the interest rates of euro ##AT##-##AT## zone government bonds show that the financial markets regard a break ##AT##-##AT## up as a real possibility .
Ten ##AT##-##AT## year government bonds in Greece and Ireland , for example , now pay nearly a full percentage point above the rate on comparable German bonds , and Italy ’ s rate is almost as high .
There have , of course , been many examples in history in which currency unions or single ##AT##-##AT## currency states have broken up .
Although there are technical and legal reasons why such a split would be harder for an EMU country , there seems little doubt that a country could withdraw if it really wanted to .
The most obvious reason that a country might choose to withdraw is to escape from the one ##AT##-##AT## size ##AT##-##AT## fits ##AT##-##AT## all monetary policy imposed by the single currency .
A country that finds its economy very depressed during the next few years , and fears that this will be chronic , might be tempted to leave the EMU in order to ease monetary conditions and devalue its currency .
Although that may or may not be economically sensible , a country in a severe economic downturn might very well take such a policy decision .
The Stability and Growth Pact , which limits euro ##AT##-##AT## zone members ’ fiscal deficits , is another reason why a country might want to leave the EMU . In a serious downturn , a country may wish to pursue a traditional Keynesian policy through large ##AT##-##AT## scale , deficit ##AT##-##AT## financed fiscal stimulus .
Although the Stability and Growth Pact may be elastic enough to permit some deficit stimulus , a country may feel constrained from acting as aggressively as it wants .
The current financial crisis raises yet another problem : the lack of a clear “ lender of last resort . ”
It remains to be seen how willing the ECB will be to provide national central banks with the volume of euros needed to play this role fully .
If a country sees its banks failing because its national bank cannot lend them enough , it may chose to leave the EMU so that its central bank can provide whatever amount of local currency it deems necessary .
Moreover , the current economic crisis has led to renewed talk about the need for the European Union to have taxing authority .
Whatever the logic of that proposition , it would open the door to much greater income redistribution .
High ##AT##-##AT## income countries might find that reason enough to want out .
Even if officials do not want to abandon the euro , they may come to do so as a result of a strategy of trying to get other countries to agree to a policy change .
A country that believes that monetary or fiscal policy is too tight may threaten to leave if policy is not changed .
That is clearly a substantial risk if the country is Germany or France .
But even if it is one of the smaller countries , it might be a serious threat because it could be seen as the beginning of the end .
So either type of country could make the threat in the hope that it would be enough to cause their EMU colleagues to agree to their desired change in policy .
The risk , of course , is that the other countries may not be intimidated .
The threatening country would then have to choose whether to accepting a humiliating defeat and stay , or stand on “ principle ” and leave .
All of this assumes that political leaders would select only a policy change that they think will be in their nation ’ s long ##AT##-##AT## term interest .
But there is also a risk that some politicians act solely out of self ##AT##-##AT## interest , seizing on the economic downturn as an opportunity to get elected by promising to withdraw the country from the EMU , or by saying that they will threaten to do so if the other member countries do not agree to their proposed policy changes .
None of these risks implies that the monetary union will inevitably be a victim of this severe economic downturn .
But the downturn will be a more severe test for the euro than any that it faced during its first ten years .
CAMBRIDGE – As the eurozone crisis continues to deepen , the International Monetary Fund may finally be acknowledging the need to reassess its approach .
New Managing Director Christine Lagarde ’ s recent call for forced recapitalization of Europe ’ s bankrupt banking system is a good start .
European officials ’ incensed reaction – the banks are fine , they insist , and need only liquidity support – should serve to buttress the Fund ’ s determination to be sensible about Europe .
Until now , the Fund has sycophantically supported each new European initiative to rescue the over ##AT##-##AT## indebted eurozone periphery , committing more than $ 100 billion to Greece , Portugal , and Ireland so far .
Unfortunately , the IMF is risking not only its members ’ money , but , ultimately , its own institutional credibility .
Only a year ago , at the IMF ’ s annual meeting in Washington , DC , senior staff were telling anyone who would listen that the whole European sovereign ##AT##-##AT## debt panic was a tempest in a teapot .
Using slick PowerPoint presentations with titles like “ Default in Today ’ s Advanced Economies : Unnecessary , Undesirable , and Unlikely , ” the Fund tried to convince investors that eurozone debt was solid as a rock .
Even for Greece , the IMF argued , debt dynamics were not a serious concern , thanks to anticipated growth and reforms .
Never mind the obvious flaw in the Fund ’ s logic , namely that countries such as Greece and Portugal face policy and implementation risks far more akin to emerging markets than to truly advanced economies such as Germany and the United States .
As the situation deteriorated , one might have guessed that the IMF would mark its beliefs to market , as it were , and adopt a more cautious tone .
Instead , at the IMF ’ s April 2011 interim meeting , a senior official declared that the Fund now considers troubled Spain to be a core eurozone country like Germany , rather than a peripheral country like Greece , Portugal , or Ireland .
Evidently , investors were supposed to infer that for all practical purposes they should think of Spanish and German debt as identical – the old hubris of the eurozone .
My own sarcastic reaction was to think , “ Oh , now the IMF thinks that some of the core eurozone countries are a default risk . ”
Having served as the IMF ’ s chief economist from 2001 to 2003 , I am familiar with the Fund ’ s need to walk a tightrope between building investor confidence and shaking up complacent policymakers .
But it is one thing to be circumspect in the midst of a crisis ; it is quite another to spew nonsense .
The late Chicago ##AT##-##AT## school economist George Stigler would have described the IMF ’ s role in Europe as reflecting acute “ regulatory capture . ”
Simply put , Europe and the US control too much power in the IMF , and their thinking is too dominant .
What European leaders may want most from the Fund are easy loans and strong rhetorical support .
But what Europe really needs is the kind of honest assessment and tough love that the Fund has traditionally offered to its other , less politically influential , clients .
The IMF ’ s blind spot in dealing with Europe until now is only partly due to European voting power .
It also stems from an “ us ” and “ them ” mentality that similarly permeates research at the top Wall Street investment houses .
Analysts who have worked their entire lives only on advanced economies have learned to bet on things going well , because for the couple of decades prior to the crisis , things mostly did go well – very well .
That is why , for example , so many keep assuming that a normal rapid recovery is just around the corner .
But the financial crisis should have reminded everyone that the distinction between advanced economies and emerging markets is not a bright red line .
In his recent speech in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke forcefully complained that political paralysis has possibly become the principal impediment to recovery .
But analysts accustomed to working on emerging markets understand that such paralysis is very difficult to avoid after a financial crisis .
Rather than slavishly believing policymakers ’ assurances , emerging ##AT##-##AT## market researchers have learned to be cynical about official promises .
All too often , everything that can be done wrong will be done wrong .
The IMF needs to bring much more of this brand of skepticism to its assessment of eurozone debt dynamics , instead of constantly seeking strained assumptions that would make the debt appear sustainable .
Anyone looking closely at Europe ’ s complex options for extricating itself from its debt straightjacket should realize that political constraints will be a huge obstacle no matter which route Europe takes .
Even outside Europe , the IMF has long given too much credence to sitting governments , rather than focusing on the long ##AT##-##AT## term interests of the country and its people .
The Fund is doing Europe ’ s people no favor by failing to push aggressively for a more realistic solution , including dramatic debt write ##AT##-##AT## downs for peripheral eurozone countries and re ##AT##-##AT## allocating core ##AT##-##AT## country guarantees elsewhere .
Now that the Fund has squarely acknowledged the huge capital holes in many European banks , it should start pressing forcefully for a comprehensive and credible solution to the eurozone debt crisis , a solution that will involve either partial breakup of the eurozone or fundamental constitutional reform .
Europe ’ s future , not to mention the future of the IMF , depends on it .
The UN and NATO are widely perceived as damaged , if not broken , by their failure to agree on what to do about Iraq .
Will these cracks in the international political system now wound the world &apos;s economic architecture , and with it globalization , as well ?
International economic agreements have never been easy to make .
Reaching consensus among the World Trade Organization &apos;s 145 members , where one dissent can cause utter disarray , was difficult even before the world &apos;s governments divided into pro- and anti ##AT##-##AT## American camps .
Indeed , multilateral trade agreements were being eclipsed by bilateral deals , such as between the EU and various developing countries , long before the divisions over Iraq appeared .
Of course , the problem goes deeper and not everything that touches globalization has turned dark .
Immigration controls , for example , have been relaxed in several European countries ( notably Germany ) due to declining populations and educational shortcomings .
But bad economic times are rarely moments when governments push bold international economic proposals .
Economic fragility among the world &apos;s leading economies is the biggest stumbling block .
The US and the EU have few fiscal and monetary levers left to combat weak performance .
Short ##AT##-##AT## term interest rates in the US , at 1.25 % , are at a 40 ##AT##-##AT## year low .
Congress has pared $ 100 billion from the Bush administration &apos;s 10 ##AT##-##AT## year $ 726 billion tax cut plan , and the US &apos;s projected 10 ##AT##-##AT## year $ 2 trillion budget deficit will grow as the Iraq war &apos;s costs mount , with President Bush submitting a supplemental request for $ 80bn ( 0.8 % of GDP ) in extra military spending this year .
Such spending risks absorb productive resources that could be employed more efficiently elsewhere .
This was demonstrated by the rapid growth of output and incomes that followed the arrival of the so ##AT##-##AT## called &quot; peace dividend &quot; which came with the Cold War &apos;s end .
Moreover , others ( Arab countries , Germany , and Japan ) will not cover America &apos;s military costs , as in the 1991 Gulf War .
We are now back to the more usual situation where war is financed by government debt , which burdens future generations unless it is eroded by inflation .
In the Eurozone the scope for fiscal stimulus ( lower taxes and / or higher public spending ) was constrained until war blew a hole in the Stability Pact , which caps member budget deficits at 3 % of GDP . The limit will now be relaxed due to the &quot; exceptional &quot; circumstances implied by the Iraq war ##AT##-##AT## providing relief , ironically , to the war &apos;s main European opponents , France and Germany .
But the European Central Bank remains reluctant to ease monetary policy .
In Japan , there seems little hope that the world &apos;s second ##AT##-##AT## largest economy can extricate itself from its homemade deflation trap to generate the demand needed to offset economic weakness elsewhere in the world .
Four years of deflation and a drawn ##AT##-##AT## out banking crisis offer little prospect of economic stimulus .
Higher oil prices and lower trade turnover aggravate the problem .
But high oil prices threaten the health of the entire $ 45 trillion world economy .
Oil prices have flirted with their highest level since the Gulf War and will go higher if Iraq &apos;s oil infrastructure ( or that of neighboring countries ) is damaged .
The adverse effects on growth will be felt everywhere , but nowhere more , perhaps , than in the energy ##AT##-##AT## dependent South Korea and China .
Although China &apos;s official growth rate reached 8 % in 2002 , its high budget deficit and large stock of non ##AT##-##AT## performing loans ( about 40 % of GDP ) mean that it cannot afford any slowdown if it is to keep people employed , especially in rural areas .
Some poor economies will be directly damaged by the loss of the Iraq market , which accounts for roughly 40 % of Vietnam &apos;s tea exports and 20 % of its rice exports .
For others , weakness in the world &apos;s big economies may be compounded by political risks .
Turkey has suffered from rising oil prices , falling tourism income ( its second ##AT##-##AT## largest source of foreign exchange ) , and declining foreign investment .
Now the Erdogan government &apos;s lukewarm support for US policy on Iraq exposes Turkey to doubts about America &apos;s commitment to its economic well being , and global markets may question its ability to service its $ 100 billion public ##AT##-##AT## sector debt in 2003 and 2004 .
The test of whether multilateral cooperation can be put back on track , and reconciled with America &apos;s war against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , may come with Iraq &apos;s reconstruction .
With the costs of ousting Saddam Hussein and occupying Iraq likely to run at anywhere from $ 100 to $ 600 billion over the next decade , the US will want to &quot; internationalize &quot; Iraq &apos;s reconstruction .
Iraq &apos;s $ 20 billion annual oil revenues cannot meet such costs .
Indeed , those revenues will scarcely cover the costs of rebuilding basic infrastructure , feeding and housing displaced populations , and paying for the country &apos;s civil administration .
After the ouster of the Taliban last year , the $ 4.5 billion of reconstruction aid pledged to Afghanistan &apos;s new government demonstrated that a multilateral approach to reconstruction is possible .
But the poisoned atmosphere that followed the UN debates on Iraq may prevent the US from getting its way here .
Already , French President Jacques Chirac has promised to veto any Security Council resolution on reconstruction that seeks to justify the war .
If the world economy is to recover , the diplomatic failures and name ##AT##-##AT## calling must end .
MOSCOW – In a recent interview , Russia ’ s President Dmitri Medvedev proclaimed that he wants a second term in office following the 2012 election , but that he would not run against Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who put him in power in the first place .
Such a rivalry , Medvedev implied , would damage the country ’ s well ##AT##-##AT## being and image .
Medvedev ’ s statement should end speculation about whether he is running , yet it keeps the suspense alive regarding Putin , whose influence is far greater than that of Russia ’ s meek president .
Many , particularly in the West , would like to see Putin and his prickly , anti ##AT##-##AT## Western authoritarianism pass from the scene .
Indeed , over the last ten years , Russian foreign policy has been animated by defensiveness and suspicion .
Russia even has uneasy relations with the congenitally non ##AT##-##AT## threatening European Union .
It is touchy about the independence of the near ##AT##-##AT## abroad countries , especially those politically or geographically close to the West – Belarus , Moldova , Ukraine , and Georgia .
More than a decade after the fact , the Kremlin still decries NATO ’ s eastward enlargement as a security threat .
The reality , of course , is that NATO is as much of an offensive threat to Russia as Switzerland is .
But it is not NATO ’ s military power that Putin ’ s Kremlin finds alarming ; the real threat is the alliance ’ s potential to “ swallow ” Moldova or Ukraine at some point .
Creating a precedent for the democratization of post ##AT##-##AT## Soviet space is a nightmare scenario for Putin and his cronies .
As in Soviet times , the main task of today ’ s ruling elite – Putin and his former KGB associates – is to preserve their tight ##AT##-##AT## knit political and economic regime , built for their personal control and material benefit .
Russian foreign policy is , as it was under the Soviets , an extension of official domestic priorities .
The current regime is clearly autocratic .
Yet it aspires to democratic legitimacy in the eyes of Russian citizens and the international community .
It is to this end that Medvedev performs his civilizing mission – participating in world forums , posting Twitter updates , berating rampant corruption , and supporting “ modernization ” and the “ rule of law . ”
The result of this duality – authoritarian establishment and Potemkin Village democratic façade – is that Russia occupies a unique geopolitical no man ’ s land .
A democratic Russia would want to catch up with the West and integrate into Western institutions .
Yet this is not in the group interests of Putin ’ s backers , the people who run , and own , Russia : its security , military , and industrial complex .
Of course , these people have been personally integrated into Europe for two decades now – their money is in European banks ; their holiday villas are in the south of France , Tuscany , and the Greek isles ; their children are educated in the poshest boarding schools .
So , despite the current regime ’ s tough , often anti ##AT##-##AT## Western rhetoric , they are not at all interested in closing Russia off from the West .
What they want is to prevent the integration with the West of Russia itself , for that would mean the end of their regime .
But , to sustain the charade of a strong and prosperous Russia , standing against the predations and hypocrisy of the West , the regime cannot be as authoritarian as Putin himself might wish .
If it were , Swiss banks and international organizations would close their doors .
So the regime ’ s backers have a strong interest in maintaining its “ democratic ” side .
The West , despite its years of experience in dealing with the Soviets , is still a sucker for such Janus ##AT##-##AT## like behavior , especially now , when Medvedev presents such an endearing democratic face .
In June , speaking at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum , Medvedev mesmerized his audience by simultaneously sounding avant ##AT##-##AT## garde and hackneyed : he attacked corruption , vowed that Russia is not “ building state capitalism , ” and promised legal and federal reforms .
Decisions , he said , should be left to business or made locally , not in the Kremlin .
The St. Petersburg Economic Forum is mostly for international consumption .
If Western bankers and investors want to buy snake oil , that is their business .
But no one should leave such events thinking that anything Medvedev says means that Russia is changing .
US Vice President Joe Biden , usually a sharp critic of Russia , arrived in Moscow in March , supposedly to convince Putin to surrender his presidential ambitions for 2012 .
A month later , talking to Putin by phone , Biden invited him to visit Washington , though , according to Russia ’ s constitution , the prime minister has no foreign ##AT##-##AT## policy role .
Does the United States support Putin in the elections , or , by recognizing Putin ’ s historic importance , do the Americans mean to convince him to leave power ?
No one knows .
Until Russia ’ s internal political situation changes , relations with the West will remain unchanged and ambiguous .
Putin , however , would be well advised to listen to Biden , who is rumored to have offered him important international positions , such as chairing the International Olympic Committee , or perhaps even leading the United Nations .
After all , Putin knows well the old Soviet playbook : the fate of previous KGB functionaries may await him .
Dreaded secret ##AT##-##AT## police chief Lavrenti Beria , who operated the machinery of repression under Joseph Stalin , was executed by the system he perfected , after being sentenced to death in 1953 for “ spying against the state . ”
In his decade in power , Putin has consolidated and strengthened the security forces , intimidated and jailed opponents , and muzzled the media and courts .
If he doesn ’ t step down or aside so that Russia can move forward , the system he has created may turn his own methods against him .
Responses to America ’ s call for democracy in the Middle East have been tepid at best .
Arab governments feel provoked by President George W. Bush , particularly as he announced his initiative with little regional consultation .
Seeking to pre ##AT##-##AT## empt American action , Egypt backed a counter ##AT##-##AT## proposal , the Alexandria Declaration , at an Arab League summit last May , and followed this with President Hosni Mubarak ’ s recent announcement that he will allow opposition candidates to challenge him for the presidency .
Is this just another stalling tactic , or an opening to real reform ?
What is clear is that the recent elections in Iraq and Palestine , together with the swelling protests against Syria ’ s distorting influence on Lebanon ’ s democracy , have reinvigorated debate about political reform within Egypt .
Members of the opposition have argued that the country is compelled to reform itself if it is not to have reform imposed from abroad .
Going further , the managing director of one newspaper claims that delaying political and constitutional reform as if it were a grant to citizens – rather than their right – would invite outside intervention in Egypt ’ s domestic affairs .
Arab democracy , he claims , has now become a domestic concern in the United States , which will make it hard for American presidents to sweep the abuses of friendly Arab regimes under the rug , as they did in the past .
In the Arab world , authoritarian governments have deprived people of political , civil , and intellectual freedoms for decades .
For young citizens , particularly Islamists , normal channels of political participation have been closed off .
As a result , they have gravitated towards underground extremist movements .
Poverty , cronyism , and official corruption heighten this popular frustration .
In this climate , the momentum for political and constitutional reform in Egypt is gathering pace .
There is great nostalgia for the last liberal experiment ( from the 1920 ’ s until the 1952 Revolution ) , which was a model for other Arab countries .
Egypt ’ s vibrant political life , press , and liberal culture were then supported by an ideology of secular nationalism and improved religious harmony .
There was a vibrant multiparty parliamentary democracy , with an independent judiciary and one of the world ’ s earliest movements for female emancipation .
The achievements and aspirations of that liberal experiment today unite Egyptians who favor reform .
They have even inspired the birth of a new political party , Hizb al ghad ( the Party of Tomorrow ) , founded by a young parliamentarian committed to democratic reform .
The party denies the argument that democracy will foster Islamic extremism and claims that it is the delay of reform that presents a major source of danger .
Hizb al ghad recently produced a 48 ##AT##-##AT## page draft constitution , aimed at reviving Egypt ’ s stagnant political life .
Its preamble , which opens with the phrase “ We , the Egyptian people , ” can be read as a scathing attack on Egypt ’ s current political order , and calls for an end to fear and despotism .
Among the document ’ s proposals is an end to the emergency rule imposed since President Anwar Sadat ’ s assassination in 1981 .
That seemingly endless “ emergency ” has resulted in the severe restriction , or even suspension , of individual and political liberties .
Other provisions include curbing the far ##AT##-##AT## reaching powers granted to the President in the 1971 constitution and introducing direct presidential elections with multiple candidates .
The draft constitution would transform Egypt into a parliamentary republic .
The dominant National Democratic Party ( NDP ) takes a different view , arguing that political change can be achieved without constitutional reform .
The NDP appears to believe that democratization must begin with changing the political culture and instilling democratic values .
These steps would precede concrete legal and constitutional reforms , such as those proposed by Hizb al ghad .
So far , however , the NDP has missed every opportunity imaginable to gain popular support by proposing a reform program designed to bring real increases in public participation .
This is one reason why Mubarak ’ s call to hold a multi ##AT##-##AT## candidate presidential election failed to galvanize Egypt ’ s electorate .
The government , indeed , prefers to offer only hollow initiatives focused narrowly on the economy .
The conflict between the two visions of reform should not obscure the fact that there is a general consensus in Egypt : substantial reform of some kind is necessary and long overdue .
Most importantly , liberal voices in Egypt are not merely a response to US democratic initiatives .
They are a homegrown challenge to an entrenched political order , and they are riding a powerful historical current .
I am writing this in New York in early August , when the mayor declared a “ heat emergency ” to prevent widespread electricity outages from the expected high use of air conditioners .
City employees could face criminal charges if they set their thermostats below 78 degrees Fahrenheit ( 25.5 Celsius ) .
Nevertheless , electricity usage has reached near ##AT##-##AT## record levels .
Meanwhile California has emerged from its own record ##AT##-##AT## breaking heat wave .
For the United States as a whole , the first six months of 2006 were the hottest in more than a century .
Europe is experiencing an unusually hot summer , too .
July set new records in England and the Netherlands , where weather data go back more than 300 years .
The hot northern summer fits well with the release of An Inconvenient Truth , a documentary film featuring former US Vice ##AT##-##AT## President Al Gore .
Using some remarkable graphs , images , and other information , the film makes a compelling case that our carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming , or , at the very least , contributing to it , and that we must urgently address the issue .
Americans tend to talk a lot about morality and justice .
But most Americans still fail to realize that their country ’ s refusal to sign the Kyoto protocol , and their subsequent business – as ##AT##-##AT## usual approach to greenhouse gas emissions , is a moral failing of the most serious kind .
It is already having harmful consequences for others , and the greatest inequity is that it is the rich who are using most of the energy that leads to the emissions that cause climate change , while it is the poor who will bear most of the costs .
( To see what you can do to reduce your own contribution , go to www.climatecrisis.net. )
To see the inequity , I merely have to glance up at the air conditioner that is keeping my office bearable .
While I ’ ve done more than the mayor requested , setting it at 82F ( 27C ) , I ’ m still part of a feedback loop .
I deal with the heat by using more energy , which leads to burning more fossil fuel , putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and heating up the planet more .
It even happened when I watched An Inconvenient Truth : on a warm evening , the cinema was so chilly that I wished I had brought a jacket .
Heat kills .
A heat wave in France in 2003 caused an estimated 35,000 deaths , and a hot spell similar to the one Britain had last month caused more than 2,000 deaths , according to official estimates .
Although no particular heat wave can be directly attributed to global warming , it will make such events more frequent .
Moreover , if global warming continues unchecked , the number of deaths that occur when rainfall becomes more erratic , causing both prolonged droughts and severe floods , will dwarf the death toll from hot weather in Europe .
More frequent intense hurricanes will kill many more .
Melting polar ice will cause rising seas to inundate low ##AT##-##AT## lying fertile delta regions on which hundreds of millions of people grow their food .
Tropical diseases will spread , killing still more people .
Overwhelmingly , the dead will be those who lack the resources to adapt , to find alternative sources of food , and who do not have access to health care .
Even in rich countries , it usually isn ’ t the rich who die in natural disasters .
When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans , those who died were the poor in low ##AT##-##AT## lying areas who lacked cars to escape .
If this is true in a country like the US , with a reasonably efficient infrastructure and the resources to help its citizens in times of crisis , it is even more evident when disasters strike developing countries , because their governments lack the resources needed , and because , when it comes to foreign assistance , rich nations still do not count all human lives equally .
According to United Nations figures , in 2002 per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the US were 16 times higher than in India , 60 times higher than in Bangladesh , and more than 200 times higher than in Ethiopia , Mali , or Chad .
Other developed nations with emissions close to those of the US include Australia , Canada , and Luxembourg .
Russia , Germany , Britain , Italy , France , and Spain all have levels between a half and a quarter that of the US .
This is still significantly above the world average , and more than 50 times that of the poorest nations in which people will die from global warming .
If a polluter harms others , those who are harmed normally have a legal remedy .
For example , if a factory leaks toxic chemicals into a river that I use to irrigate my farm , killing my crops , I can sue the factory owner .
If the rich nations pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide , causing my crops to fail because of changing rainfall patterns , or my fields are inundated by a rise in the sea level , shouldn ’ t I also be able to sue ?
Camilla Toulmin , who directs the International Institute for Environment and Development , a London ##AT##-##AT## based NGO , was present at a lecture on climate change that Al Gore gave in June .
She asked him what he thought about compensation for those who are hit hardest by climate change , but who have done the least to cause it .
The question , she reports on www.opendemocracy.net , seemed to take him by surprise , and he did not support the idea .
Like Toulmin , I wonder if this is a truth that is just too inconvenient , even for him .
America ’ s defense policy is at a crossroads .
Since 1997 , the United States Congress has required the Department of Defense to undertake a major defense review every four years .
The department is currently developing the third such review and will release it later this year .
The review promises to be nothing short of a watershed .
The last Quadrennial Defense Review was published a few weeks after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . As a result , it gave only hints of the counterterrorism strategy to come .
The 2005 review , by contrast , will represent several years of thinking by the Bush administration , and thus will serve as a key indicator of the future course of American defense policy .
The grand strategy that serves as the foundation for American defense policy has not undergone major change since 2002 .
Focusing on terrorism , the strategy calls for strengthening the network of international partners seeking to eradicate transnational terrorism , and for direct action against terrorist organizations and their sponsors .
Ultimately , it seeks to address what President Bush considers the root causes of terrorism , particularly the absence of open political systems and economic opportunity .
What is changing is the way that US military power is used to implement this grand strategy .
There is little doubt that the 2005 Defense Review will formalize the change in focus underway since September 11 , 2001 .
Before that , the American military concentrated on swift victory in a major theater war against another state ’ s military forces .
Today , however , the US military is more likely to be used to stabilize and rebuild failed states , assist partners in countering insurgency and terrorism , control nuclear weapons when regimes collapse , or directly eradicate terrorist organizations and their supporters .
This requires a different type of force , and one capable of running a marathon rather than a sprint , sustaining major deployments for extended periods .
The global configuration of America ’ s military is also changing .
The goal is to keep most of the force stationed at home in the US , with a network of lightly ##AT##-##AT## manned bases abroad that can serve as forward operating locations during a crisis or war .
Rather than being miniature Americas , many of these bases will be operated in conjunction with or by the host nation .
This will capitalize on the US military ’ s ability to project force around the world quickly , while providing a more flexible and politically palatable way of doing so .
But , beyond the ongoing changes , major strategic questions persist .
First , how much conventional war ##AT##-##AT## fighting capability should the US military retain ?
The goal is to maintain enough to deter aggressors , but not so much that it detracts from other , more likely missions .
Second , what will America ’ s relationship with its traditional allies be ?
Will formal alliances such as NATO remain the centerpiece of American strategy , or will they be superseded by mission ##AT##-##AT## specific coalitions ?
Third , how much should the US continue to invest in advanced , high ##AT##-##AT## tech weapons more appropriate for conventional enemies than for fighting terrorists or insurgents ?
Systems such as the F / A ##AT##-##AT## 22 Raptor aircraft and the Army ’ s Future Combat System are extraordinarily expensive .
At a time when deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are straining the defense budget and much of the military ’ s existing equipment needs repair or replacement , questions arise as to whether such programs are a good investment .
Fourth , what is the appropriate size of the US military ?
Many defense intellectuals , former military leaders , and politicians believe that America ’ s military , particularly the ground forces , are too small to implement Bush ’ s grand strategy .
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , on the other hand , believes the size of the military is adequate if it is re ##AT##-##AT## organized for maximum efficiency . He is also concerned that an increase in the size of the military will diminish funds available for advanced technology and systems .
Because Rumsfeld is the primary architect of the upcoming defense review , it is very unlikely to recommend an increase in the size of the force .
The changes underway in American defense policy reflect planning assumptions .
The strategy that emerges will be only as strong as these assumptions are accurate .
The upcoming defense review will mandate changes based on events of the past five years , focusing especially on Iraq , Afghanistan , and other aspects of the war on terror .
The question is whether future American military missions will replicate those of the past five years .
If not , the US might be preparing for the last war rather than the next one .
One hopes that the 2005 Defense Review will address this issue , although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate .
In any case , the new review will serve as a roadmap for future US defense policy , thus affecting America ’ s partners and adversaries alike .
TOKYO – The scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March was far greater than even the authorities ’ worst scenarios foresaw .
Nearly six months later , the total damage remains difficult to estimate .
Social unrest and confusion , as well as radiation leaks from the Fukushima nuclear power plant , continue .
And now the country has absorbed another huge blow : another downgrade of its bond ratings .
Both Moody ’ s and Standard &amp; amp ; Poor ’ s now rate Japanese bonds at only their fourth ##AT##-##AT## highest level .
So what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows ?
Last year , Japan ’ s economy grew at a relatively healthy 3 % annual rate , higher than in the United States or the European Union , owing mainly to the fiscal expansion undertaken after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 .
But growth in 2011 had been predicted to slow even before the earthquake .
Indeed , the economy shrank by 3.5 % year on year in the first quarter .
Now , with so much fixed capital and infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami , the economy ’ s productive capacity has fallen by an estimated 2 % of GDP .
But that may not be a bad thing : Prior to the earthquake , Japan had a demand ##AT##-##AT## supply gap of approximately 5 % of GDP .
While reducing this gap to 3 % of GDP has led to higher prices , this is exactly what Japan needs after years of persistent deflation .
Meanwhile , higher public spending on capital investment and other special procurements will boost domestic demand .
The Hanshin earthquake in 1995 destroyed capital stock worth 2 % of GDP .
This time , the loss is estimated at 3.4 % of GDP , implying a larger increase in domestic demand if the right public policies are pursued .
On the downside , confidence among consumers and investors alike has taken a hit , mainly owing to fears about radiation leakages and power shortages .
According to the Japan Center for Economic Research , power ##AT##-##AT## supply disruptions could negatively affect the Japanese economy for the next three years .
If the Tokyo metropolitan area ’ s power supply were to decrease by 10 % this year , for example , Japan ’ s GDP would fall by 2 % .
Soon after the disaster , the government announced that reconstruction demand and higher prices would bring about relatively rapid economic recovery .
I think this view is too optimistic , because I suspect that the government wants to finance its new expenditure with a tax hike .
Moreover , the extremely sharp contraction in first ##AT##-##AT## quarter GDP may indicate that the disaster ’ s negative impact on the economy was more significant than expected .
Indeed , the economy is expected to have shrunk by another 2.6 % year on year in the second quarter , with growth set to resume only in July ##AT##-##AT## September .
And , contrary to the government ’ s outlook , the start of economic recovery could be delayed until the end of this year , with medium ##AT##-##AT## term annual growth reaching 1.5- 2 % .
A key question has been the disaster ’ s impact on global supply chains .
According to Japan ’ s Ministry of Economy , Trade , and Industry , which surveyed firms roughly a month after the earthquake , more than 60 % of production sites in affected areas had already recovered as of April 15 .
Almost 30 % expected to recover by the summer , and the remaining 10 % foresaw normal operations after the autumn .
But the impact of even a small number of disruptions to supply chains can be highly significant , particularly for the Asia ##AT##-##AT## Pacific region .
Consider Renesas Electronics , a medium ##AT##-##AT## size company , with ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.9 billion ) in annual sales , which accounts for more than half of worldwide production of essential micro ##AT##-##AT## computing components for automobiles .
Partly as a result of the damage at Renesas , Toyota ’ s capacity ##AT##-##AT## utilization rate dropped to 50 % at the beginning of May .
Likewise , the chemical manufacturer Kureha ( ¥ 130 billion in annual sales ) has a 70 % share of the global market for adhesive materials for lithium ##AT##-##AT## ion batteries – a small but essential component of cell phones .
Nokia in Finland , for example , imports 12 % of its cell ##AT##-##AT## phone components from Japan , and thus could be indirectly affected by the disaster .
As a result , more companies are likely to create and implement business continuity plans . Indeed , “ BCP ” is set to become a key term in the region ’ s economic discourse .
Using BCPs to determine alternative producers means that regional economies will be integrated in a new form , with companies establishing cooperative relationships even with their competitors .
Unfortunately , Japan ’ s public officials appear incapable of similar flexibility .
The disaster confirmed the traditional view of Japan as a country that combines a dynamic private sector with an anemic public sector and central administration .
The government ’ s mistakes in so ##AT##-##AT## called “ risk communication ” regarding the Fukushima nuclear plant , and its slowness in getting necessary aid to people displaced by the disaster , have once again put the stereotype on full display .
In terms of international relations , however , the disaster could improve Japan ’ s bilateral ties with influential countries .
For example , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and South Korean President Lee Myung ##AT##-##AT## bak met with outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan in Fukushima , near the damaged plant – &amp; nbsp ; helping to ease neighboring countries ’ concerns about radiation leakage .
Moreover , Japan ’ s relations with the US , which had suffered since the Democratic Party of Japan came to power two years ago , appear to have emerged from the disaster stronger than ever .
Japan ’ s Self ##AT##-##AT## Defense Forces played an important role in rescue and restoration activities , with about half of its 200,000 personnel dispatched to the damaged area .
While this severely weakened Japan ’ s defenses , the US ensured East Asia ’ s security by deploying an aircraft carrier and cruisers , and American forces also searched for missing victims together with the JSDF .
But Japan ’ s neighbors expect rapid reconstruction and normalization , and for that , stronger political leadership is needed .
The earthquake and tsunami have confronted Japan with a profound crisis – but also with a rare opportunity to undertake the comprehensive reforms that the country has postponed for far too long .
On November 4 ##AT##-##AT## 5 , the fourth Summit of the Americas took place in Mar del Plata , Argentina .
The heads of state of the hemisphere ’ s democratic countries met to discuss economic , political , and social issues – and to lose another opportunity to create a new and healthier relationship between the United States and its Latin American neighbors .
Indeed , the Summit amounted to nothing more than an outsized photo opportunity .
No important issues were resolved , and no progress was made on the many topics that increasingly divide the countries of Latin America and the US .
In particular , no progress was made on the creation of a free ##AT##-##AT## trade area for the region .
This is all the more disappointing , given that the region ’ s leaders declared more than a decade ago , during the first Summit of the Americas , held in Miami in December 1994 , that free ##AT##-##AT## trade negotiations would be “ concluded no later than 2005 . ”
At the center of the failure to make headway on the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) is America ’ s unwillingness , and that of the Bush administration , to open up its agricultural sector to competition from countries such as Argentina , Brazil , and Uruguay .
True , the US is not the worst offender in the world when it comes to farm protectionism ; the European Union ’ s trade distortions are significantly more pervasive .
But it is also true that if the US wants to improve relations with its neighbors to the south , America should make significant bilateral trade concessions to the Latin American countries .
In the absence of US leadership in matters of international trade , the majority of Latin American countries will not open their economies further to foreign competition , and some may even return to increased protectionism .
Unfortunately , the lack of progress on trade ##AT##-##AT## related issues is not the only burden on relations between the US and Latin America . There are also serious diplomatic and political problems .
Very few Latin American countries support the Iraq war ; indeed , only a handful of small countries in the region contributed troops to the so ##AT##-##AT## called “ coalition of the willing , ” and today only El Salvador still has its troops in Iraq .
More broadly , most Latin American governments are increasingly critical of the Bush administration ’ s foreign policy , and they are unlikely to support major initiatives in international forums , including in the United Nations .
Moreover , a growing number of Latin American countries are veering left , and Hugo Chávez , the belligerent and anti ##AT##-##AT## American Venezuelan president , is becoming increasingly popular in every Latin American country .
Voters across Latin America are becoming skeptical of market ##AT##-##AT## oriented policies and globalization , making it more likely that in coming years , and under new leadership , economic policies in the region will be less friendly to foreign investment in general , and to US economic interests in particular .
It is not too late for the US to regain its political and diplomatic influence in Latin America .
But improving relations with its neighbors to the South will require making commitments at several levels .
Three commitments are particularly important . First , US agricultural protectionism should be reduced .
Second , immigration reform in the US should be enacted in a way that protects the rights of Latino migrants . And , third , the US should support the demands of Latin American countries for a greater say in international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
These initiatives will give the signal to Latin American leaders that , despite appearances to the contrary – including the latest Summit of the Americas – the region has not been completely neglected by President Bush and the US .
WASHINGTON , DC – John Boehner , Speaker of the United States House of Representatives , is leading the Republican Party ’ s charge on fiscal policy , arguing that his side needs to see “ trillions of dollars ” in spending cuts in order for Congress to approve an increase in the US government ’ s debt ceiling .
But framing the issue this way creates a major problem for Boehner : it will directly , completely , and quickly antagonize one of the Republicans ’ most important constituencies – the US corporate sector .
Focusing on the debt ceiling creates a political trap for Boehner and the Republicans .
It is true that the US Treasury ’ s ability to borrow will reach its legally authorized limit in early August .
It is also true that whenever Republicans rattle their sabers about the debt ceiling , and threaten not to raise it , the bond market yawns and there is no significant impact on yields .
If the Republicans ’ threats were credible , any news that increased the likelihood of a problem with the debt ceiling would send Treasury bond prices down and yields up .
This is not happening , because bond traders cannot imagine that the Republicans would be able – or even willing – to follow through .
After all , the consequences of failing to increase the debt ceiling would be catastrophic .
The entire credit system in the US – and in much of the rest of the world – is based on the notion that there are “ risk ##AT##-##AT## free assets , ” namely US government securities .
There is no provision in the US Constitution to guarantee that the US will always pay its debts , but the American Republic has proven itself for 200 ##AT##-##AT## plus years to be about as good a credit risk as has ever existed .
US fiscal resolve has been tested at least five times : at independence , in the war of 1812 , during and after the Civil War , and in World War I and World War II .
We can debate the exact fiscal pressures in each case , and precisely how various kinds of bondholders were treated , but the simple fact of the matter is that when the going gets tough , the US pays its debts .
At least in the near term , the chance that the US will not service its debt is vanishingly small – perhaps in the same order of probability as a large meteor striking the earth .
To be sure , there are big fiscal questions to be sorted out – including how much the government should spend and on what , as well as how much tax it should collect and by what means .
There is also the vexing question of how much debt is too much for the modern US .
In a world where international investors ( from both the private and official sectors ) routinely wring their hands about US fiscal deficits – and then go out and buy more US government debt – who knows the answer ?
Countries never default because they can ’ t pay their debts ; there are always ways to decrease expenditures or raise taxes .
Countries default because their political processes bring them to the point where the people in power decide , for whatever reason , not to pay the government ’ s debts .
It is not difficult to identify who would bear what costs if the US did not pay – or if it disrupted markets by not increasing its debt ceiling .
Everyone who borrows or interacts with the credit system in any way would suffer a shock that would make the crisis of 2008 look small .
Among others , the US corporate sector – big and small business – would be livid .
To be sure , executives and entrepreneurs like to shake their heads over the current US fiscal deficit .
And some of them engage constructively in debates about the real issues : how to control health ##AT##-##AT## care costs , prevent future financial crises , and end America ’ s expensive foreign wars .
But these are the issues for the presidential election of 2012 , in which one hopes for debates that will set a more encouraging fiscal agenda for the next 20 ##AT##-##AT## 30 years .
How and when America ’ s budget problems will be resolved is unknown , but US fiscal history is encouraging – the Republic has managed and survived crisis before .
Simply put , America will not score an own goal over the debt ceiling – and Boehner must know it .
Symbolic gestures are to be expected , as with the threatened government shutdown earlier this year , which merely created fodder for political advertising by both parties .
But any manufactured debt crisis now would deeply antagonize the corporate sector – and most of the electorate .
In the wake of economic disaster , the party held responsible would presumably be exiled from power for a generation ( the Great Depression kept the Republicans from the US presidency for 20 years ) .
The Republican leadership is making threats that are not credible .
If Barack Obama ’ s administration plays its hand well , the result will be a last ##AT##-##AT## minute extension of the debt ceiling with no significant concessions .
It is unclear how Boehner or anyone else would be able to portray that as a political victory .
CAMBRIDGE – Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the United States ##AT##-##AT## Japan Security Treaty , a central feature of stability in East Asia for half a century .
But now , with the Japanese experiencing a period of domestic political uncertainty , and North Korea ’ s nuclear tests and missile launches increasing their anxiety , will Japan reverse its long ##AT##-##AT## standing decision not to seek a national nuclear ##AT##-##AT## deterrent capability ?
Is the US ##AT##-##AT## Japan alliance coming to an end ?
In the early 1990 ’ s , many Americans regarded Japan as an economic threat .
Some people – in both countries – viewed the security alliance as a Cold War relic to be discarded .
These trends were reversed by the Clinton administration ’ s 1995 “ East Asia Strategy Report . ”
In 1996 , the Clinton ##AT##-##AT## Hashimoto Declaration stated that the US ##AT##-##AT## Japan security alliance was the foundation for stability that would allow growing prosperity in post ##AT##-##AT## Cold War East Asia .
That approach has continued on a bipartisan basis in the US , and polls show that it retains broad acceptance in Japan .
Most close observers of the relationship agree that the US ##AT##-##AT## Japan alliance is in much better shape today than 15 years ago .
Nonetheless , the alliance faces three major challenges in a new external environment .
One is North Korea , whose recent behavior has been clever and deceptive .
The North Koreans have violated their agreements , knowing that China , the country with the greatest potential leverage , is most concerned about regime collapse in North Korea , and thus the threat of chaos on its borders .
Japan officially endorses the objective of a non ##AT##-##AT## nuclear world , but it relies on America ’ s extended nuclear deterrent , and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear blackmail from North Korea ( or China ) .
The Japanese fear that the credibility of American extended deterrence will be weakened if the US decreases its nuclear forces to parity with China .
It is a mistake , however , to believe that extended deterrence depends on parity in numbers of nuclear weapons .
Rather , it depends on a combination of capability and credibility .
During the Cold War , the US was able to defend Berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the NATO alliance and the presence of American troops , whose lives would be on the line in the event of a Soviet attack .
Indeed , the best guarantee of American extended deterrence over Japan remains the presence of nearly 50,000 American troops ( which Japan helps to maintain with generous host ##AT##-##AT## nation support ) .
Credibility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional ballistic missile defense .
Equally important are American actions that show the high priority that the US gives to the alliance , and its guarantees not to engage in what Japan fears will be “ Japan ##AT##-##AT## passing ” in its relations with Asia .
That is why it was so important that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s first trip was to Asia , and her first stop in Japan .
It is also why it is mistaken to speak of a formal G ##AT##-##AT## 2 with China , rather than multilateral cooperation .
A second challenge for Japan is the dramatic rise of China ’ s economy . Although an important trade partner , China ’ s growing power makes Japan nervous .
When re ##AT##-##AT## negotiating the US ##AT##-##AT## Japan security alliance in the 1990 ’ s , Japanese leaders sometimes privately asked me if the US would desert Japan in favor of China .
I responded then ( and today ) that there is little prospect of such a reversal , for two reasons .
First , China poses a potential threat , whereas Japan does not .
Second , the US shares democratic values with Japan , and China is not a democracy .
Moreover , China ’ s internal evolution remains uncertain .
While Chinese are more free today than at any time in their history , China ’ s political evolution has lagged behind its economic progress .
Unlike India , China has not solved the problem of political participation .
There is always a residual danger that China will embrace nationalism to ward off domestic problems .
At the same time , it is in the interest of the US , Japan , and China that China ’ s rise be peaceful and harmonious ( in the words of Chinese leaders ) .
Treat China as an enemy , and you guarantee enmity .
That is why the strategy of integration , plus a hedge against uncertainty , makes sense for both the US and Japan .
Indeed , there are strong grounds for the US , Japan , and China to engage in areas of trilateral and other regional cooperation .
Third , the US ##AT##-##AT## Japan alliance will have to face a new set of transnational challenges to our vital interests , such as pandemics , terrorism , and human outflows from failed states .
Chief among these challenges is the threat posed by global warming , with China having surpassed the US as the leading producer of carbon ##AT##-##AT## dioxide emissions ( though not in per capita terms ) .
Fortunately , this is an area that plays to Japan ’ s strengths .
Although some Japanese complain about the unequal nature of the alliance ’ s security components , owing to the limits that Japan has accepted on the use of force , in these new areas , Japan is a stronger partner .
Japan ’ s overseas development assistance in places ranging from Africa to Afghanistan , its participation in global health projects , its support of the United Nations , its naval participation in anti ##AT##-##AT## piracy operations , and its research and development on energy efficiency place it at the forefront in dealing with the new transnational challenges .
Given today ’ s agenda , there is enormous potential for an equal partnership , working with others , in the provision of global public goods that will benefit the US , Japan , and the rest of the world .
That is why I remain optimistic about the future of the US ##AT##-##AT## Japan alliance .
The World Bank and IMF have completed their annual meetings , which were greeted by street demonstrations and a paucity of innovative ideas .
Here George Soros suggests a bold new tack to restructure the world &apos;s financial system .
The international financial system is broken down in the sense that it fails to provide adequate capital to countries that need it most and qualify for it .
Global financial markets suck most of the world &apos;s savings to the center , but they fail to pump money back out to the periphery .
Indeed , since 1997 , there has been a reverse flow of capital from countries on the poor periphery of the world economy to those in the wealthy center .
The facts speak for themselves .
America runs a chronic current account deficit approaching an astonishing 5 % of GDP ; $ 242 billion in the first half of this year .
At the same time , Brazil - which has followed sound economic policies and has healthy budget and trade surpluses - cannot refinance its debt at acceptable rates .
The prevailing belief that market discipline corrects such imbalances is false , for two reasons .
First , financial markets are inherently unstable .
Second , the international financial system is biased in favor of the wealthy center .
Instability arises because financial markets try to discount a future that depends on their own behavior .
It is now recognized that this can lead to what economists call &quot; multiple equilibria , &quot; but we continue to deny the clear implication that financial markets cannot be left to their own devices .
In practice , of course , international financial markets never have been left to their own devices .
Rich countries , led by the US , are in charge .
Their primary task is protecting their own interests .
When these countries get into trouble , their authorities intervene forcefully .
Countries that cannot borrow in international markets in their own currency lack that power .
They must turn to the IMF , and the IMF is more concerned with international financial stability than with enabling developing countries to pursue the countercyclical policies needed to avoid recession .
Until recently , IMF rescue programs were designed to enable debtor countries to meet their obligations .
Taxpayers in debtor countries , such as Mexico , picked up the tab .
This may have been unfair , but at least it kept money flowing to the periphery .
The emerging market crisis of 1997 ##AT##-##AT## 1998 changed all this .
That crisis was attributed not to instability in the financial markets and the lopsidedness of the system , but to the &quot; moral hazard &quot; introduced by IMF bail ##AT##-##AT## outs .
This lead to a U ##AT##-##AT## turn : from bail ##AT##-##AT## outs to &quot; bail ##AT##-##AT## ins , &quot; and to private sector burden sharing .
Moral hazard has been curtailed but the risks of investing in emerging markets increased .
Those risks are now reflected in market prices , which is the source of today &apos;s problem .
What can prevent the situation from deteriorating further and perhaps culminating in a systemic crisis ?
In the broadest terms , we must create a more level playing field .
There is nothing wrong with imposing market discipline on countries that follow unsound policies , but the risk ##AT##-##AT## reward ratio for lending and investing has shifted too far against the periphery .
Countries that qualify ought to have access to a lender of last resort and be empowered to pursue countercyclical policies .
Brazil , for example , confronts an unambiguous case of market failure .
Although the maximum sustainable real interest rate is about 10 % , Brazil &apos;s dollar ##AT##-##AT## denominated debt yields 24.5 % .
A one ##AT##-##AT## year Real note pays 27 % .
At these rates , Brazil is heading for bankruptcy .
If no lender of last resort ensures that credit is available at or below 10 % , Brazil cannot be expected to meet its obligations - dealing a terrible blow both to Brazil and the international financial system .
Where there is a political will , there is a way .
For instance , the central banks of the US , Europe , Japan , and Britain could accept Brazilian paper at their discount windows .
The IMF could guarantee the central banks against market risk at current prices .
This would provide a tremendous boost to the market and drastically reduce interest rates .
Naturally , all guarantees would be conditional on Brazil abiding by the IMF agreement .
If successful , the IMF guarantee would never be invoked .
What I propose is novel : it would leverage the IMF &apos;s $ 30 billion loan to Brazil tenfold ( and set a useful precedent ) .
Unfortunately , such a scheme exceeds the imagination and political will of the IMF &apos;s shareholders .
But let &apos;s be clear : failure to address the problem could have disastrous consequences .
After all , how would a Brazilian default affect Mexico ?
Addressing the broader , system ##AT##-##AT## wide problem , we must find ways to stimulate domestic ##AT##-##AT## led growth in the periphery countries .
Countries that follow sound macroeconomic policies do not derive sufficient economic benefits from doing so .
This generates political discontent that could have adverse consequences beyond the economic sphere .
At present , the US serves as the motor of the global economy .
But a chronic current account deficit is unsound , unfair , and unsustainable in the long run .
More urgently , the US motor is sputtering .
It would be benefit all parties to start another motor .
To this end , I proposed an annual issue of Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) that rich countries would donate for international assistance .
This is a proposal whose time has come because the world economy is hovering on the brink of deflation .
Until recently , globalization unfolded against the background of a global boom ; now we are experiencing a global bear market .
I am afraid globalization may not survive unless we find new ways to stimulate the global economy .
The SDR donation scheme would activate resources that are currently idle , benefiting donors and recipients .
It would also reduce the increasing inequality between rich and poor countries .
KYIV – Ukraine ’ s parliamentary election on October 28 will be neither free nor fair .
After eight unproductive years since the 2004 Orange Revolution , the democratic opposition is depressed and demoralized .
Even so , the elections may check President Viktor Yanukovych ’ s power .
Yanukovych came to power in February 2010 , in elections that were rated free and fair ( and at a time when Freedom House still ranked Ukraine as democratic ) .
But he quickly consolidated power and turned Ukraine into a mildly authoritarian state .
A dozen prominent opposition politicians have been sentenced to prison , including former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and the former interior minister , Yuri Lutsenko .
Tymoshenko , who was and remains the leader of the liberal and pro ##AT##-##AT## Western opposition , was sentenced to seven years in prison for a gas deal with Russia in which she was not even accused of having benefited personally .
Without her , the democratic opposition has no strong leader .
But Yanukovych has not stopped there .
He exerts heavy pressure on private television channels , and has blocked licenses and cable access for the independent television channel TVi , which has exposed the most serious corruption cases of his administration .
Moreover , he uses the civil service and law ##AT##-##AT## enforcement authorities extensively to repress the opposition and promote his protégés .
And yet the upcoming election matters .
Ukraine has a vibrant civil society and excellent free Internet media .
But the opposition , which comprises half the country , is badly demoralized after five years of stalemate among the Orange Revolution ’ s leaders , for which the largest share of blame falls on former President Viktor Yushchenko , who by almost all accounts has betrayed the democratic breakthrough that he represented .
He now leads a party that supports Yanukovych , who has even allowed Yushchenko to remain in the presidential residence since leaving office .
Ukrainian voters are fickle .
They voted against the incumbent powers in the presidential elections of 1994 , 2004 , and 2010 . They may do so again .
The most recent public ##AT##-##AT## opinion poll suggested that Yanukovych ’ s Party of Regions would obtain 28 % of the vote , and that its only ally to surpass the 5 % electoral threshold would be the communists , with 11 % , giving them a total of 39 % , compared to 36 % for two opposition parties , Tymoshenko ’ s Fatherland party ( 19 % ) and the heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko ’ s UDAR ( 17 % ) .
The predatory nature of Yanukovych ’ s rule is not exactly well hidden ; his family members and loyalists control the entire security apparatus and the main economic agencies .
He is rightly scared by the democratic opposition , which he is emasculating by all reasonably soft means .
Anticipating that his party might lose the upcoming election if Ukraine ’ s proportional voting system were maintained , Yanukovych has reverted to the electoral system of 2002 , with only half of the 450 seats to be distributed proportionally .
The remaining 225 seats will be filled in winner ##AT##-##AT## take ##AT##-##AT## all single ##AT##-##AT## member constituencies – a change that gives regional tycoons a great opportunity to buy seats .
But Yanukovych failed to anticipate that tycoons would dare to be disloyal to him .
Initially , his government contained nine groups of big businessmen , but that number has fallen gradually , and even top businessmen have been marginalized by his core loyalists , who are widely rumored to be enriching themselves at the expense of both the state and private business .
Unlike Russian President Vladimir Putin , Yanukovych seems to have steamrolled too many too fast , overestimating his power and narrowing his base .
Indeed , he appears to have turned all of Ukraine ’ s top oligarchs into his enemies .
Each summer , the prominent Ukrainian businessman Victor Pinchuk organizes a major international conference , the Yalta European Strategy , attended by the Ukrainian elite and prominent foreigners .
This September , the lesson of the conference was that Yanukovych has isolated himself not only from the West and Russia , but also from his main backers at home .
The Ukrainian tycoons are no fools .
They view the upcoming election as their last chance to stand up against Yanukovych .
The many parliamentarians to be elected in single ##AT##-##AT## member constituencies are more likely to obey them than Yanukovych .
Under the electoral system in place in 2002 , the ruling party quickly disintegrated into nine oligarchic party factions .
Something similar is likely to happen this time around .
The tycoons might not oust Yanukovych , but they will check his power .
Their most vocal public representatives are First Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy and the economy minister , Petro Poroshenko , who was a major force behind the Orange Revolution .
The businessmen ’ s main objection to Yanukovych is that he prefers to keep Tymoshenko in prison rather than obtain an Association Agreement with the European Union .
The already ##AT##-##AT## concluded free ##AT##-##AT## trade agreement with the EU would offer Ukraine badly needed market access and increased exports , but the EU will not ratify it unless Tymoshenko is released and repression of the opposition and media ceases .
Similarly , the tycoons advocate restored cooperation with the International Monetary Fund , because they want access to credit at reasonable interest rates .
But Yanukovych refuses to liberalize gas prices , a key IMF demand .
Concern that the West ’ s pro ##AT##-##AT## reform stance will push Ukraine into Russia ’ s embrace is largely unfounded .
Yanukovych ’ s personal relations with Putin are so poor that Putin all but refuses to talk to him – other than to make preposterous demands .
The West thus has an important role to play in the election , and is providing two thousand election monitors to help to ensure a free and fair vote .
Indeed , the United States and the EU , in particular , have a large stake in the outcome .
Ukraine is a friendly country – one that always joins Western “ coalitions of the willing . ”
But it is a lapsed democratic country .
They must help to change that .
September 11 , 2001 , is one of those dates that mark a transformation in world politics .
Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9 , 1989 , signified the Cold War ’ s end , al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda ’ s attack on the United States opened a new epoch .
A non ##AT##-##AT## governmental group killed more Americans that day than the government of Japan did with its surprise attack on another transformative date , December 7 , 1941 .
While the jihadi terrorist movement had been growing for a decade , 9 / 11 was the turning point .
Five years into this new era , how should we characterize it ?
Some believe that 9 / 11 ushered in a “ clash of civilizations ” between Islam vs. the West .
Indeed , that is probably what Osama bin Laden had in mind .
Terrorism is a form of theater .
Extremists kill innocent people in order to dramatize their message in a way that shocks and horrifies their intended audience .
They also rely on what Clark McCauley and others have called “ jujitsu politics , ” in which a smaller fighter uses the strength of the larger opponent to defeat him .
In that sense , bin Laden hoped that the US would be lured into a bloody war in Afghanistan , similar to the Soviet intervention two decades earlier , which had created such a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists .
But the Americans used a modest amount of force to remove the Taliban government , avoided disproportionate civilian casualties , and were able to create an indigenous political framework .
While far from perfect , the first round in the fight went to the US .
Al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda lost the sanctuaries from which it planned its attacks ; many of its leaders were killed or captured ; and its central communications were severely disrupted .
Then the Bush administration succumbed to hubris and made the colossal mistake of invading Iraq without broad international support .
Iraq provided the symbols , civilian casualties , and recruiting ground that the jihadi extremists had sought in Afghanistan .
Iraq was George Bush ’ s gift to Osama bin Laden .
Al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda lost its central organizational capacity , but it became a symbol and focal point around which like ##AT##-##AT## minded imitators could rally .
With the help of the Internet , its symbols and training materials became easily available around the world .
Whether al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda had a direct role in the Madrid and London bombings , or the recent plot to blow up airliners over the Atlantic , is less important than the way it has been transformed into a powerful “ brand . ”
The second round went to the extremists .
The outcome of future rounds in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will depend on our ability to avoid the trap of “ jujitsu politics . ”
That will require more use of the soft power of attraction rather than relying so heavily on hard military power , as the Bush administration has done .
For the struggle is not a clash of Islam vs. the West , but a civil war within Islam between a minority of terrorists and a larger mainstream of non ##AT##-##AT## violent believers .
Jihadi extremism cannot be defeated unless the mainstream wins .
Military force , intelligence , and international police cooperation needs to be used against hardcore terrorists affiliated with or inspired by al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda , but soft power is essential to attracting the mainstream and drying up support for the extremists .
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once said that the measure of success in this war is whether the number of terrorists we are killing and deterring is larger than the number that the terrorists are recruiting .
By this standard , we are doing badly .
In November 2003 , the official number of terrorist insurgents in Iraq was given as 5,000 .
This year , it was reported to be 20,000 .
As Brig. General Robert Caslen , the Pentagon ’ s deputy director for the war on terrorism , put it , “ We are not killing them faster than they are being created . ”
We are also failing in the application of soft power .
According to Caslen , “ We in the Pentagon are behind our adversaries in the use of communication – either to recruit or train . ”
The manner in which we use military power also affects Rumsfeld ’ s ratio .
In the aftermath of 9 / 11 , there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for America ’ s military response against the Taliban .
The US invasion of Iraq , a country that was not connected to the 9 / 11 attacks , squandered that good will , and the attractiveness of the US in Muslim countries like Indonesia plummeted from 75 % approval in 2000 to half that level today .
Indeed , occupying a divided nation is messy , and it is bound to produce episodes like Abu Ghraib and Haditha , which undercut America ’ s attractiveness not just in Iraq , but around the world .
The ability to combine hard and soft power is smart power .
When the Soviet Union invaded Hungary and Czechoslovakia during the Cold War , it undercut the soft power that it had enjoyed in Europe in the aftermath of World War II .
When Israel launched a lengthy bombing campaign in Lebanon last month , it created so many civilian casualties that the early criticisms of Hezbollah by Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia became untenable in Arab politics .
When terrorist excesses killed innocent Muslim civilians such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad did in 1993 or Abu Musab al ##AT##-##AT## Zarqawi did in Amman in 2005 , they undercut their own soft power and lost support .
The most important lesson five years after 9 / 11 is that failure to combine hard and soft power effectively in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will lead us into the trap set by those who want a clash of civilizations .
Muslims , including Islamists , have a diversity of views , so we need to be wary of strategies that help our enemies by uniting disparate forces behind one banner .
We have a just cause and many potential allies , but our failure to combine hard and soft power into a smart strategy could be fatal .
CAMBRIDGE : Despite NASDAQ crashes and the threat of US recession , the New Economy is here to stay .
Indeed , it remains the key to improved performance in Europe and Japan in the years ahead .
But where , exactly , does the heart of the New economy lie ?
Is it in more competitive labor markets or in better tax systems or in deregulation ?
Corporate governance , too , is a motor of the New Economy that should not be underrated .
If managers create productive , flexible structures focused on wealth creation , companies find it easy to adjust and explore new sources of productivity and cost control .
If decentralization and risk taking are part of a company ’ s mission , innovation in products and processes is certain to take place .
If , on the contrary , bosses behave like cautious executors of a wealthy estate , their companies will soon look like museums .
A country ’ s economic performance , indeed , is a mirror image of its resident companies .
Countries with great companies show great performance .
Where then are the great companies of the world to be found ?
No surprise that more than half of the most respected companies are American .
Although Europe is roughly the same economic size as the US , it has far fewer winning corporate teams .
Japan may be much smaller than America or Europe , but it underperforms its share of G7 income or wealth .
The picture could not be clearer : the US economy performs stunningly , as does its corporate sector ; Europe is far behind ; and Japan does not really register .
Peering into the future of this premier league of companies five years from now , the FT sees a number of shifts as likely , with Europe catching up , Japan losing even more ground , and America giving up some ground , too .
This glimpse into the future mirrors today ’ s perceptions of a maturing ( a code ##AT##-##AT## word for losing its edge ) American economy and a Europe able to play catch ##AT##-##AT## up because the new business culture is at last taking hold .
This survey also accurately reflects the reality that very few Japanese firms are succeeding at the hard task of restructuring , of shifting to modern , world ##AT##-##AT## class governance .
World ##AT##-##AT## class Sony stays ahead ; NTT ( its Docomo subsidiary is the key here ) holds on , but old and tired Honda and Matsushita are likely to be relegated to second class status .
The dynamics of the next 5 years will also reflect a head ##AT##-##AT## on competition between winning corporations .
Boeing versus Airbus may be the most interesting example .
In the current rankings , both are locked in a clinch close to the bottom of the FT list of top firms .
In 5 years , however , Airbus will likely be up and Boeing out of the champions league altogether .
Why ?
Airbus has looked ahead , invested , and is bringing on a new Jumbo jet that will make Boeing ’ s existing products look outdated and inefficient .
For Boeing became complacent and forgot that the airline business is a cut ##AT##-##AT## throat world .
When thinking about economic potential , we tend to look at the quality of the labor force , a people ’ s willingness to work , and the level of education .
Seen from this perspective , Europe and Japan should trounce the US because of their far superior basic education systems , and Japanese discipline make Europeans look lazy .
In fact , effort and education are not what matters most .
Far more significant is the economic environment in which people work – a market economy versus some form of socialism – and the organization of businesses in which they participate .
The best model of corporate governance to produce strong and lasting economic performance remains to be found .
In the 1980s , respect for the long ##AT##-##AT## run view of the Japanese model ran high .
This is no longer so because of Japan ’ s economic malaise .
Then there was the flirtation with the German model of business ##AT##-##AT## banking integration , which brings capital markets in ##AT##-##AT## house .
That lost its attraction when it became clear that cozy relations between bankers and bosses result in tolerance for poor rates of return on capital .
Now the US model is in : decentralized , lean on middle management , tough on the CEO ; and with a “ don ’ t take no for an answer ” code .
But this won ’ t be the last answer , although for the time being it will drive corporate restructuring and the managerial mind .
All this begs the question as to whether it makes sense to change corporate cultures every 10 or 20 years .
The pragmatic answer is that it takes very different models to handle a stable and stationary world as opposed to a world in which deregulation and technology produce dramatic change daily .
The US model works in times of rapid , pervasive change .
This is what lies ahead for the foreseeable future .
Hold on tight .
On both sides of the Atlantic , many view economic globalization as a threat to below ##AT##-##AT## average earners .
According to a recent poll by the German Marshall Fund , majorities in France , Germany , and the United States favor maintaining existing trade barriers , even if doing so hampers economic growth .
Clearly , the large net gains from global economic integration are not enough to convince those who have lost their jobs and the many others who feel at risk .
The recently established European Globalization Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is an EU ##AT##-##AT## wide response to this challenge .
The EGF can spend up to € 500 million annually in EU member states on workers affected by trade ##AT##-##AT## induced layoffs .
But sharing the benefits of globalization with the losers is traditionally regarded as a national responsibility .
For example , the inspiration for the EGF , America ’ s Trade Adjustment Assistance , introduced by the Kennedy administration in 1962 , is a purely national scheme .
Is EU involvement really justified ?
The economic case for a European globalization fund is that trade policy has been delegated to the European level , while Union members retain control rights to block decisions .
Consider the hypothetical example of full trade liberalization in textiles , which would have greatly asymmetric effects between , say , Sweden , with hardly any textile industry , and Portugal , with a substantial one .
Sweden would be a clear beneficiary while Portugal would be hit hard , owing to the large number of displaced textile workers .
The negative impact of such redundancies is serious .
OECD statistics show that 40 % to 50 % of displaced manufacturing workers in the EU15 remain without a job 24 months after becoming unemployed .
Around 30 % work in a job that pays less than the previous one .
Only around one ##AT##-##AT## quarter are re ##AT##-##AT## employed with a wage at or above the previous level ( see chart ) .

Through the EGF , part of the cost of helping displaced textile workers would be borne by all EU countries , thereby making wider trade liberalization a more likely prospect .
Although Sweden , for example , would be a net contributor to the EGF , it might well be a net beneficiary of the arrangement as a whole .
In principle , a web of bilateral transfer arrangements could achieve such an unblocking of trade .
In practice , however , such transfers hardly ever take place , so the potential gains from opening trade may fail to materialize .
Nevertheless , the EGF ’ s rules need to be tightened , lest the scheme comes to be regarded as a political gimmick .
The current setup leaves too much room for discretion , as neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for aid are clearly spelled out .
This will expose the EGF to wasteful political posturing and lobbying by countries and sectors .
The EGF ’ s rules should be amended to ensure that governments and trade ##AT##-##AT## displaced workers receive transparent , visible , and reliable assistance , as well as to spread best practice in active labor market policy .
Displaced workers often face unemployment , a lower ##AT##-##AT## paying job , or a new job far from home . Of these , the unemployed typically receive most public support .
To address this distortion head on , and to provide clarity concerning the allocation of funds , the EGF should focus its limited funds on two simple active labor market programs : wage insurance and mobility allowance .
Wage insurance could offer workers whose pay was cut after displacement compensation for up to two years amounting to half the difference between the old and the new wage .
The mobility allowance could offer those moving for a new job a lump ##AT##-##AT## sum payment of two months ’ gross pay in the previous job , or four months ’ pay for cross ##AT##-##AT## border moves .
The very simplicity of this scheme will likely ensure high visibility and reasonable take ##AT##-##AT## up rates .
The downside of such a focused approach is also clear : the margin of choice for EU members about how EGF funds are to be spent in their country would be minimal .
In view of the likely advantages , this might be acceptable if member states could be assured that , if the schemes work , it will be expanded .
This can be done as part of a reform of the European Social Fund , which has an annual budget of around € 10 billion – twenty times the current funding of the EGF .
If the EGF does not prove effective , the money can simply be given back to the EU budget or to member states .
But if the EGF does work , the benefits would far outweigh the costs .
NEW HAVEN – On April 2 , the G ##AT##-##AT## 20 will hold a summit in London to discuss what we may hope will be an internationally coordinated plan to address the world economic crisis .
But can such a plan really work ?
The basic problem , of course , is confidence .
People everywhere , consumers and investors alike , are canceling spending plans , because the world economy seems very risky right now .
The same thing happened during the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s .
A contemporary observer , Winthrop Case , explained it all in 1938 : economic revival depended “ on the willingness of individual and corporate buyers to make purchases that necessarily tie up their resources for a considerable length of time .
For the individual , this implies confidence in the job , and in the end comes equally back to the confidence of industry leaders . ” Unfortunately , confidence did not return until World War II ended the depression .
If the leaders meeting in London are to succeed where governments failed in the 1930 ’ s , they must commit themselves to a fiscal target that is sufficient to restore full employment under normal credit conditions .
They must also commit themselves to a credit target that will restore lending to normal .
People will not spend normally unless they have both a job and normal access to credit .
During the Great Depression , such targets were not used on a large enough scale , merely fueling public despair that stimulus policies would ever work .
The G ##AT##-##AT## 20 Summit should also be an occasion for affirming some basic principles .
Confidence isn ’ t built up on the basis of spending or lending alone .
People need to believe that the money represents something more lasting than stimulus measures , which may eventually end in failure .
After all , the Great Depression did not end simply because of the massive stimulus of war ##AT##-##AT## related expenditures .
Why should World War II have produced any confidence in the future ?
To be sure , World War II reduced the unemployment rate in the United States dramatically , from 15 % in 1940 to 1 % in 1944 , and had a similar effect in other countries .
But this was not because of a revival in business confidence . It was because of a nasty war , plain and simple , with people drafted into fighting , or into industries supplying the war effort .
The real recovery of confidence did not occur until after World War II , when the world did not sink back into depression .
The US Council of Economic Advisors warned of this possibility in 1949 , and it was not alone .
There appears to be more than one reason why , on the contrary , confidence came roaring back .
First , there was a general perception of “ pent ##AT##-##AT## up demand . ”
After years of privation ( and in many countries the physical destruction of war ) , people just wanted to live normally – to rebuild , own a home , a car , and other consumer goods .
The widespread impression that there was such pent ##AT##-##AT## up demand also led people to believe that there could not be another depression .
The perception of pent ##AT##-##AT## up demand was like a powerful economic stimulus package , and it had the advantage that people believed it would be long ##AT##-##AT## lasting .
Indeed , the same long ##AT##-##AT## term confidence triggered the post ##AT##-##AT## war “ baby boom . ”
According to some contemporary observers , however , “ pent ##AT##-##AT## up demand ” was only part of the story .
During the brief but deep recession of 1949 , the financial commentator Silvia Porter reflected on the attitudes that led to the 1929 crash : “ We saw nothing wrong – in fact , we saw everything right – with the wild speculative boom and credit inflation that … culminated in the now almost unbelievable gambling orgy of 1929 . ”
But now , Porter wrote , after the depression and war , “ We began to listen to the idea that a hundred million citizens , acting through a central government , could achieve much more than a hundred million acting as separate selfish units .
We developed , in short , a new attitude toward the responsibilities of government . ” She concluded that the positive effect of “ pent ##AT##-##AT## up demand ” and government measures can “ make sense only when viewed against the background of our changed economic and political philosophy . ”
The Marshall Plan , which operated from 1947 to 1951 , became a symbol of this new attitude .
The US gave billions of dollars of aid to rebuild war ##AT##-##AT## ravaged countries in Europe .
The plan was widely viewed as reflecting a new kind of enlightenment , a recognition of the importance of supporting people who needed help .
Europe would not be allowed to languish , and the stimulus came from abroad .
After the war , Keynesian economic theory , which was generally not accepted or understood during the Great Depression , became the basis of a new social compact .
It was a theory that was perfectly suited to a generation that had just endured exceptional sacrifices , for it reaffirmed a belief in our responsibility for each other .
The effect of economic stimulus is redoubled by this kind of inspirational belief .
That is why all of the commitments made and intentions expressed at the upcoming G ##AT##-##AT## 20 summit matter .
The countries represented must show a generous spirit and make the world economy work for all people .
Seemingly peripheral issues , like aid to the developing world and the poor , who suffer the most from a crisis like this one , will be part of the primary story of the renewal of confidence , just as the Marshall Plan was part of that story after World War II .
CHICAGO – If any solution to the European crisis proposed over the next few days is to restore confidence to the sovereign ##AT##-##AT## bond markets , it will have to be both economically viable and politically palatable to rescuers and rescued alike .
This means paying attention not just to the plan ’ s technical details , but also to appearances .
There is growing consensus about any solution ’ s key elements .
First , Italy and Spain will have to come up with credible medium ##AT##-##AT## term plans that will not just restore their fiscal health , but also improve their ability to grow their way out of trouble .
While any plan will involve pain for citizens , the markets must deem the pain politically tolerable , at least relative to the alternatives .
It is important that these plans be seen as domestically devised ( though voters will have no illusions about the external and market pressures that have forced their governments to act ) .
At the same time , an external agency such as the International Monetary Fund could render the plan more credible by evaluating it for consistency with the country ’ s goals and monitoring its implementation .
Second , some vehicle – the IMF or the European Financial Stability Facility , with either entity funded directly by countries or the European Central Bank – has to stand ready to fund borrowing by Italy , Spain , and any other potentially distressed countries over the next year or two .
But there is an important caveat , which has largely been ignored in public discussions : if this funding is senior to private debt ( as IMF funding typically is ) , it will be harder for these countries to regain access to markets .
After all , the more a country borrows in the short term from official sources , the further back in line it pushes private creditors .
That makes private lenders susceptible to larger haircuts if the country eventually defaults – and thus more hesitant to lend in the first place .
In other words , private markets need to be convinced both that there is a low probability of default ( hence the importance of credible plans ) , and that there is some additional loss ##AT##-##AT## bearing capacity in the new funding , so that , if there is a default , outstanding or rolled ##AT##-##AT## over private debt does not have to bear the full brunt .
This may seem unfair .
Why should the taxpayer accept a loss when they are bailing out the private sector by providing new funding ?
In an ideal world , distressed countries would default as soon as private markets stopped funding them , and they would impose the losses on private bondholders .
In the real world , however , if Italy and Spain are viewed as being solvent , or too big to fail , official funding should be structured so that it gives these countries their best chance to regain market confidence .
This does not mean that official funding should be junior to private debt in any restructuring , for that would require substantially more loss ##AT##-##AT## bearing capacity from the official sector – capacity that is probably not available .
Indeed , if official funding were junior , it would be providing a larger cushion to private creditors – and thus bailing them out to an even greater extent .
The simplest solution is to treat official funding no differently from private debt – best achieved if official lenders buy sovereign bonds as they are issued ( possibly at a predetermined yield ) and agree to be treated on par with private creditors in a restructuring .
As the country regains market confidence , the official funding can be reduced , and eventually the bonds can be sold back to the markets .
The bottom line is that official funding must be accompanied by loss ##AT##-##AT## bearing capacity .
If the funding is channeled through the IMF , and is to be treated on par with private debt , the Fund will need a guarantee from the EFSF or strong eurozone countries that it will be indemnified in any restructuring .
Of course , the IMF ’ s member states might be willing to accept some burden sharing if a sufficient buffer provided by the eurozone were eroded , but that cannot be taken for granted .
Once the first two elements of the plan are in place , there should be little need for the third – bond purchases by the ECB in the secondary market in order to narrow interest ##AT##-##AT## rate spreads and provide further confidence .
Indeed , if the ECB intends to claim preferred ##AT##-##AT## creditor status for any bonds that it buys , it is probably best that it buy very few .
Of course , the ECB will have to continue to provide support to banks until confidence about their holdings returns .
But there is one more element that is needed to assure markets that the solution is politically viable .
Citizens across Europe , whether in rescued countries or rescuing countries , will be paying for years to clean up a mess for which they were not responsible .
Not all banks voluntarily loaded up on distressed government bonds – some were pressured by supervisors , others by governments – but many have made unwise bets .
If they are seen as profiting unduly from the rescue , even as they return to their bad old ways of paying for non ##AT##-##AT## performance , they will undermine political support for the rescue – and perhaps even for capitalism .
So a final element of the package ought to be a monitored pledge by eurozone banks that they will not unload bonds as the official sector steps in ; that they will raise capital over time instead of continuing to deleverage ( if this hurts bank equity holders , they should think of this as burden sharing ) ; and that they will be circumspect about banker bonuses until economies start growing strongly again .
Cries that this is not capitalism should be met with a firm retort : “ Nor are bailouts ! ”
Afghanistan ’ s future hangs in the balance as its weak national government struggles to maintain support and legitimacy in the face of a widening insurgency , warlords , the heroin trade , and a disappointed populace .
Across an arc extending from Afghanistan to East Africa , violence now also surges in Iraq , Lebanon , Somalia , and beyond , to Sudan ’ s Darfur region .
Everywhere , politicians , generals , and even diplomats talk of military strategies and maneuvers , but everywhere something utterly different is needed .
Stability will come only when economic opportunities exist , when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families , rather than seeking their fortune in violence .
We are seeing again and again that a foreign army , whether NATO ’ s in Afghanistan , America ’ s in Iraq , Israel ’ s in occupied Palestine , or Ethiopia ’ s in Somalia , may win a battle , or even a war , but never the peace .
Peace is about dignity and hope for the future .
Military occupation saps dignity , and grinding poverty and economic disarray sap hope .
Peace can be achieved only with a withdrawal of foreign troops , and the arrival of jobs , productive farms and factories , tourism , health care , and schools .
Without these , military victory and occupation quickly turn to ashes .
The United States government has proven itself blind to these facts , but the international community also remains ill equipped to assist in the restoration of peace following conflicts in impoverished countries .
Repeatedly , a fragile peace has broken down because of the lack of economic follow ##AT##-##AT## up .
Despite grand promises of foreign aid , economic reconstruction , and development in Afghanistan , Iraq , Lebanon , and elsewhere , the actual record of international assistance to post ##AT##-##AT## war reconstruction is gravely deficient .
The scenario has become painfully familiar .
A war ends .
An international donors ’ conference is called .
Pledges of billions of dollars are announced .
A smiling new head of state graciously thanks the international community , including the occupying power .
Months pass .
World Bank teams from Washington start to arrive .
But actual reconstruction and recovery is delayed , perhaps for years .
Crony businesses from the US and Europe , which are utterly unfamiliar with local conditions , squander time , aid funds , and opportunities .
Two or three years pass .
The grand pronouncements become a pile of out ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## date World Bank studies .
Recriminations fly , the occupying army remains , and a new insurgency spreads .
Many factors contribute to this disarray , beginning with the shocking inability of the US , Europe , and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people .
Their lack of empathy is deplorable , but there are conceptual problems as well .
The international agencies involved in post ##AT##-##AT## conflict reconstruction have so far failed to understand how to start or restart economic development in a low ##AT##-##AT## income setting .
It ’ s important to distinguish four distinct phases of outside help to end a conflict .
In the first phase , during the war itself , aid is for humanitarian relief , focusing on food , water , emergency medicine , and refugee camps .
In the second phase , at the war ’ s end , aid remains mainly humanitarian relief , but now directed towards displaced people returning home , and to decommissioned soldiers .
In the third phase , lasting three to five years , aid supports the first phase of post ##AT##-##AT## war economic development , including restoration of schools , clinics , farms , factories , and ports .
In the fourth phase , which can last a generation or more , assistance is directed to long ##AT##-##AT## term investments and the strengthening of institutions such as courts .
The international community , and the US in particular , is dreadful at the third stage .
Once a conflict is over , aid agencies seem paralyzed .
Instead of sending help , they send study groups .
There is often a lag of years before moving from humanitarian relief to real economic development .
By the time such help actually arrives , it is often too late : war has been re ##AT##-##AT## ignited .
In fact , it is possible to restart economic development through targeted “ quick ##AT##-##AT## impact ” initiatives .
Since the economies of most impoverished post ##AT##-##AT## conflict countries are based on agriculture , restarting farm output is vital .
Impoverished farmers should receive a free package of seeds , fertilizers , and low ##AT##-##AT## cost equipment ( such as pumps for irrigation ) .
When such aid is made available quickly , former soldiers will return to their farms , and can establish a livelihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hostilities .
This type of aid does not require long studies , but quick action .
Similar quick ##AT##-##AT## impact measures should be undertaken to control disease .
Small rural clinics can be built or rebuilt very quickly , within the first year of peace .
Solar panels and wind turbines can provide off ##AT##-##AT## grid power in isolated rural areas . Wells and cisterns can be put in place to ensure safe drinking water .
These and similar efforts can mean the difference between famine and food security , epidemic disease and health , income and utter poverty , and , most importantly , hope and despair .
Yet the window of opportunity closes quickly .
Quick ##AT##-##AT## impact economic development is exactly what is needed now to help end the horrific violence and suffering in Darfur .
Sanctions , threats , and peacekeepers are only short ##AT##-##AT## term measures , whereas real progress there against extreme poverty is not only achievable , but also is something that the government and rebels can agree on .
The same applies in Somalia .
But the window of opportunity closes quickly in these and other post ##AT##-##AT## conflict regions .
Only by taking quick , meaningful action to fight hunger , poverty , and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long ##AT##-##AT## term peace .
WASHINGTON , DC – Is the Arab Spring turning into a gloomy autumn ?
With brutal crackdowns in Syria , a bloody civil war in Libya , and Yemen teetering on the brink of chaos , the number of skeptics is growing .
Although Egypt and Tunisia ’ s pro ##AT##-##AT## democracy movements achieved rapid regime change , uncertainties remain in those countries , too .
After a brief period of hope , many observers now wonder whether the region is capable of producing viable , and economically vibrant , democracies .
Revolutions and their aftermaths , of course , are always fluid and fickle times , and the outcome is often perched on a knife ’ s edge .
Bridging the vast gap between high expectations and the reality of limited budgets and capabilities is a test in itself .
Redressing past injustice and building an economy that offers opportunity to all are major challenges as well , fraught with volatility , uncertainty , and the dangers of political opportunism .
But transitions are also times of great opportunity .
In the 1990 ’ s , I was among those Indonesians who demanded and celebrated the departure of our own autocrat , Suharto , and I joined the new government when he left .
Many observers predicted that Indonesia , the world ’ s most populous Muslim country , would be unable to sustain democracy and would ultimately decline into chaos .
The task ahead of us was daunting .
But we proved the skeptics wrong , and learned some fundamental lessons .
Perhaps most importantly , we learned that there is no one ##AT##-##AT## size ##AT##-##AT## fits ##AT##-##AT## all solution for democratization .
Each of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa will face unique challenges , which will have to be addressed on their own terms .
Even so , they all must make a real and symbolic break with the past .
The new authorities must send strong signals that the old ways are finished .
Change must be formally manifested , with new laws that are widely publicized .
Legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression , free and independent elections , and freedom of association is crucial , and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law .
Anything less will undermine the transition .
Moreover , corruption is the bane of development everywhere , so new governments should move fast to establish institutions and procedures to fight it .
Transparency and accountability are powerful ideas with near ##AT##-##AT## universal support , which means that new leaders should not give up when the fight becomes difficult .
Civil ##AT##-##AT## society organizations , local communities , representatives of the poor and vulnerable , and women play a vital role in this regard , and they should be included at every level of decision ##AT##-##AT## making .
In Indonesia , we signed a hundred laws in less than 18 months , covering everything from media freedom to elections , corruption , decentralization , and anti ##AT##-##AT## trust rules .
We ratified new public ##AT##-##AT## finance legislation and ensured the independence of the country ’ s central bank .
New leaders must also expect and manage setbacks .
In post ##AT##-##AT## revolutionary times , expectations are high , and the obstacles to meeting them are enormous .
I know from personal experience that we did not always have the luxury of getting the best outcomes .
We had to compromise and settle for the best possible results .
Security threats are among the most serious setbacks in transitions .
Nationalistic sentiment is strong , and politicians and interest groups can exploit it .
Often , the security forces are holdovers from the old regime , and there is no independent judicial system .
Reforms will take time , and the old bureaucracies may not be able to implement them .
In Indonesia , we used various innovations to work around such dilemmas .
For example , we appointed an independent judge to take over the bankruptcy and corruption courts , because career judges were too tainted .
Likewise , when we started cash ##AT##-##AT## for ##AT##-##AT## work programs as part of our pro ##AT##-##AT## poor agenda , we asked communities to run these initiatives .
More broadly , new leaders are well advised to ensure that the economy performs well .
It is important to restore economic activity and create a favorable environment for entrepreneurs , particularly small and medium ##AT##-##AT## size businesses , which constitute the main engine of job creation .
The recent revolutions , it should be recalled , started with the self ##AT##-##AT## immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor , who was harassed and insulted by the authorities .
But economic success without accountability and social inclusion is not sustainable , and new governments often must face tough choices in order to protect the poor and vulnerable .
They might have to abolish mis ##AT##-##AT## targeted subsidies to free up resources for more targeted and efficient anti ##AT##-##AT## poverty and job ##AT##-##AT## creation programs .
In Indonesia , we had to draw a line between the very poor and the near ##AT##-##AT## poor .
We could not afford to raise salaries or provide subsidies for everybody .
Our help had to be targeted .
So , while we helped the neediest , we excluded others who were not poor enough to benefit .
This was a tough and unpopular choice .
Finally , countries in transition need support – not only money , but also technical know ##AT##-##AT## how to implement highly complex reforms .
When I became Indonesia ’ s finance minister , I had 64,000 employees .
But when we had to modernize our tax system , we could not find the required expertise anywhere in our country .
Yes , we needed external assistance , but we never surrendered “ ownership ” of the reform process ; we made it work for us .
If we Indonesians had not been in charge of our own transition , it could easily have failed .
That lesson , too , is one that all countries in transition should bear in mind .
Despite considerable effort by the international community in Afghanistan since 2001 to eliminate the Taliban and al Qaeda , the insurgency in the south of the country has gathered momentum at breakneck speed in recent months .
Our field research shows that we are not winning the campaign for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people – the Taliban are .
Indeed , the international community ’ s methods of fighting the insurgency and eradicating poppy crops have actually helped the insurgents gain power .
The international community has so far pursued policies of destruction , rather than the promised reconstruction .
The aggressive United States ##AT##-##AT## led counter ##AT##-##AT## narcotics policy of crop eradication has failed to win the support of Afghans , because it has triggered a chain reaction of poverty and violence in which poor farmers , with their only livelihood destroyed , are unable to feed their families .
This has been exacerbated by the failure to provide even the most basic aid and development in the country ’ s poorest areas .
At the same time , communities have been torn apart as a result of bombing campaigns , which have destroyed the very homes we came to protect .
This , in addition to four years of drought , has forced entire families to leave their villages for makeshift internal refugee camps .
You do not win people over by bombing them , but by helping them .
The Taliban have exploited the failures of the international community in extremely effective anti ##AT##-##AT## Western propaganda that has fueled significant doubt in the minds of the public concerning the reasons justifying the international presence in Afghanistan .
Sadly , our troops are often the first to pay the price – sometimes with their lives .
It is not too late to win back the hearts and minds of the Afghan people .
International troops are excelling in an exceptionally hostile environment , but this is not a war that will be won by military means alone .
With public perception a crucial factor in winning the war , and the Taliban poised to launch a large military initiative next spring , failure to adopt a successful local strategy could signify the last chance the international community will have to build a secure and stable Afghanistan .
But a successful strategy – one that responds to Afghanistan ’ s extreme poverty crisis – requires that the international community reverse course on crop eradication .
In fact , the eradication of poppy crops not only damage local communities and undermines the international community ’ s goals , but it is also failing : opium production last year was at an all ##AT##-##AT## time high .
In September , the United Nations Office on Drugs Crime announced that poppy cultivation soared by a record ##AT##-##AT## high 60 % .
Eradication will never be successful in Afghanistan , because it destroys the single crop that will grow in the south ’ s harsh climate – and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people .
So a new , long ##AT##-##AT## term , economically sustainable solution is urgently needed – one that directly engages with the communities that are suffering most – in order to achieve the support of the deeply impoverished rural population .
As a way to address this dilemma , the Senlis Council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for Afghanistan , which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process .
A system in which poppy is cultivated under license for the production of pain ##AT##-##AT## killing medicines such as morphine and codeine would allow farmers to pursue their traditional livelihood and way of life , and , more importantly , to feed themselves and their families .
There is a global shortage of morphine and codeine , particularly in underdeveloped countries , where these vital medicines are often in short supply , if not completely unavailable .
Not only would poppy licensing address the poverty and hunger crises that have engulfed the south of Afghanistan ; it also would stabilize existing local structures , giving communities a reason to support President Hamid Karzai ’ s government and the international community .
Farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter ##AT##-##AT## narcotics efforts , in sharp contrast to the current idealistic – and evidently un ##AT##-##AT## achievable – policy of crop eradication .
We must have the backing of the Afghan people if we are to defeat the Taliban .
By endorsing such an initiative , the international community would demonstrate that it is in Afghanistan for the good of the local population , which would help farmers sever ties with the insurgency .
But for such a system to be successful , the extreme poverty in the south of the country must first be our top priority .
According to the World Food Program , 70 % of the population lack food security .
An immediate injection of emergency food and medical aid is urgently needed to break the vicious circle of suffering and violence .
Only then could a new , long ##AT##-##AT## term development strategy in Afghanistan – one that admits that the international community is not winning the war , and that the status quo is unacceptable – be implemented .
Licensing the opium crop would be a realistic and pragmatic cornerstone of that strategy ’ s success .
GENEVA – Switzerland ’ s direct democracy allows citizens who have gathered enough petition signatures to challenge government policies and laws in nationwide referenda .
After a spate of AIDS deaths during the 1980 ’ s , the Swiss came face to face with a problem that has destroyed millions of lives in the United States , Russia , Latin America , the European Union , southern Asia , and other regions .
Intravenous drug users – especially heroin addicts – had turned public spaces in Zurich and other Swiss cities and towns into needle parks . AIDS proved itself to be blind to affluence .
The Swiss did not respond with the kind of neglect that Russia ’ s government has shown so far toward its heroin and HIV epidemics – more than two million drug users and an estimated one million people living with HIV , over 60 % of them infected while sharing contaminated needles . Nor did the Swiss react with a “ war on drugs ” and massive funding for more policing , more jails , and mandatory prison sentences .
That war is well and truly lost .
The US now incarcerates more people than any other country , largely as a result of soaring drug convictions , with a disproportionate number of African ##AT##-##AT## American and Hispanic prisoners . The war on drugs has enabled drug cartels to reap higher profits than ever and transform entire communities in Latin America into fiefdoms .
Drug money is corrupting democratic governments and law ##AT##-##AT## enforcement institutions around the world .
Drug ##AT##-##AT## related violence has consumed untold numbers of victims in Afghanistan , Burma , Colombia , the US , and Mexico .
The Swiss re ##AT##-##AT## examined their government ’ s drug policies with a pragmatic eye .
Health professionals took the lead in a campaign to press the government – through the mechanisms of direct democracy – to shift its focus from arresting and punishing drug users toward public ##AT##-##AT## health policies that are based on scientific evidence of what works .
The Swiss implemented methadone programs. and , in order to prevent the spread of HIV , they created needle exchanges , including in prisons , and established safe injection rooms on a large scale .
The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health also oversaw an experiment in prescribing heroin to people who had lived with opiate dependency for significant periods .
The Swiss government ’ s careful evaluation of this approach demonstrated that heroin ##AT##-##AT## assisted therapy is both feasible and cost ##AT##-##AT## effective , and that it can bring patients significant health improvements .
Moreover , it contributed to a startling drop in drug ##AT##-##AT## related crime .
The Swiss public was so convinced of the benefits of heroin ##AT##-##AT## assisted therapy that , in two nationwide votes , voters endorsed the policy , despite domestic political opposition and criticism from the International Narcotics Control Board .
Switzerland is a conservative country .
Trafficking in illicit narcotics remains illegal .
In November 2008 , the Swiss rejected a proposal for Dutch ##AT##-##AT## style decriminalization of cannabis .
And some policymakers question whether the Swiss approach has focused drug policy too much on public health and too little on dealing with the poverty and social exclusion faced by drug users .
Switzerland ’ s pragmatic approach to drug abuse has nonetheless yielded significant lessons that are applicable to the US , Russia , and the many other drug- and HIV / AIDS ##AT##-##AT## ravaged countries over which they wield significant influence .
So have similar approaches in Portugal , which only a decade ago led the EU in drug ##AT##-##AT## related HIV / AIDS cases .
Portugal ’ s decision in 2001 to decriminalize possession of illegal drugs led not only to more drug users in treatment ( rather than in prison ) , but also a significant decrease in the number of drug users newly infected with HIV .
One lesson is the crucial importance of using scientifically rigorous investigation of new programs – rather than populist rhetoric , religious moralizing , and urban myth – to guide policymaking .
This requires coordinating policing and health programs within a coherent policy framework , investing in research and public education on drug policy , opening new programs to independent review , and standing up to ideological criticism , both domestic and international , with evidence and pragmatism .
To convey these and other significant lessons , and to advocate worldwide for effective harm ##AT##-##AT## reduction policies – and for broader public debate about more efficient and humane drug policies – we and other world leaders have initiated the Global Commission on Drug Policy , which held its inaugural meeting in Geneva in January .
Our aim is to show that the war on drugs is lost .
Switzerland , Portugal , and other countries have demonstrated that there is a better way forward , combining pragmatism and cost effectiveness with compassion and respect for human rights .
Will World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz ’ s troubles finally catalyze real change at the World Bank ?
Will there finally be an end to the archaic practice by which the President of the United States unilaterally appoints the head of the world ’ s most important development agency ?
Facing an extraordinary rebuke from the Bank ’ s ministerial oversight committee and open revolt from his professional staff , Wolfowitz has faint hope of limping through the last three years of his term .
The immediate uproar is over the exceedingly generous pay and promotion package that Wolfowitz awarded in 2005 to his girlfriend as compensation for leaving the Bank to pave the way for his arrival .
At a time when the Bank has been emphasizing high governance standards as the key to development , the recent revelation of that arrangement ’ s details have dealt a serious blow to the Bank ’ s credibility .
But even if Wolfowitz is eventually forced to resign , nothing will be gained if US President George W. Bush is allowed summarily to choose his replacement , as US Presidents have been doing ever since the Bank was founded after World War II .
Instead , the Bank ’ s head should be chosen in an open and transparent process that aims to select the best ##AT##-##AT## qualified candidate , whether from the US , Europe , or the developing world .
Indeed , a big part of Wolfowitz ’ s weakness today is the way he came to his job , as an in ##AT##-##AT## your ##AT##-##AT## face appointment from a US administration weak at international cooperation .
The World Bank is a development finance institution .
But Wolfowitz ’ s background at the US State and Defense Departments gave him no real expertise or experience in either area .
Instead , his claim to fame was his role as architect of America ’ s failed war in Iraq .
By all accounts , Wolfowitz is brilliant , but it seems inconceivable that an open , transparent , and multilateral selection process would have chosen him to head the World Bank .
I reach this conclusion even though I am sympathetic to the Bush administration ’ s desire to catalyze change at the Bank .
I have long advocated shifting the Bank ’ s center of gravity from lending to outright grants , a policy that the Bush administration strongly endorses .
But choosing someone with no obvious background or experience in economic development was not the way to make progress on this front .
A more open selection process , indeed , would have zoomed in on the fact that Wolfowitz ’ s girlfriend worked at the Bank .
This may seem a trivial issue , but it is not , given the Bank ’ s strong policies to protect against nepotism .
If Wolfowitz were otherwise overwhelmingly the most qualified candidate , the selection committee may have found a way to finesse the issue , openly and transparently .
But , given his questionable fit for the job in the first place , the girlfriend issue might have been disqualifying .
Why does the world meekly go along with the status quo and let the US dictate the Bank ’ s top position ?
It is a sorry tale of poor global governance .
Europe does not get in America ’ s way because it wants to maintain Europe ’ s equally out ##AT##-##AT## dated privilege of appointing the head of the International Monetary Fund , the Bank ’ s sister institution .
Asia has little choice but to defer to the US and Europe ’ s shenanigans because it is grossly under ##AT##-##AT## represented in both organizations .
As for Africa , its leaders are loath to do or say anything that might interrupt the flow of World Bank largesse .
Many people , including myself , have long complained about the leadership selection process at the World Bank and the IMF .
How can the Bank and the Fund continue to go around lecturing developing economies on good governance and transparency but fail to allow change in their own houses ?
Now and again , both organizations pay lip service to the issue .
But so far , they have exhibited no real desire for change .
To be fair , the IMF ’ s leadership is making a determined effort to give dynamic emerging economies , particularly in Asia , a bigger say in Fund governance .
If carried far enough , this process would ultimately catalyze the necessary changes .
Unfortunately , the IMF ’ s rebalancing efforts are proceeding at a glacial pace .
At the World Bank , nothing seems to be happening at all .
Perhaps when Gordon Brown becomes the UK ’ s next prime minister , he will be able to convince the G7 group of rich countries to lead the charge for change .
As head of the Fund ’ s ministerial oversight committee , Brown understands the issues as well as anyone .
Or perhaps the Wolfowitz debacle will prove to be the catalyst .
Maybe at last , the next World Bank or IMF president will come from outside their usual domains .
There are plenty of great potential non ##AT##-##AT## American candidates .
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has ably served as head of the World Bank ’ s oversight committee and would make a brilliant World Bank president .
And it still could be a qualified American .
What about Bill Clinton ?
One way or the other , the Bank and the IMF leadership selection process urgently needs to be revamped .
What the Wolfowitz debacle tells us most clearly is that the time for patience with the status quo is over .
COPENHAGEN – A girl born in South Asia or sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan Africa faces a cruel double burden .
She will grow up in a region beset by poverty , disease , war or famine . She will also confront these challenges with the added disadvantage of being female .
Although more attention is being given to gender issues , inequality persists in every culture , country , and continent .
A new study for the Copenhagen Consensus project shows that eliminating this disparity is an investment with high payoffs .
Despite global interest in education for all , many girls in poor countries continue to be denied basic education ; right from the start , they are disadvantaged .
Three in five illiterate children in the world are girls .
Particularly in South Asia and sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan Africa , cultural norms and economic hardships stop parents from sending their daughters to school or from keeping them in school for as long as they enroll their sons .
This unequal investment is neither equitable nor efficient .
An obvious solution is to build more schools in places where girls and boys must be educated separately .
In poor Muslim countries like Pakistan , Yemen , and Morocco , single ##AT##-##AT## sex schooling is the norm , but many rural areas can afford only one public school , which is usually set aside for boys .
In theory , about half of the education gap in these areas could be closed by building girls ’ schools .
Elsewhere , supply constraints are not the problem .
Instead , policymakers must find ways to strengthen the incentives for parents to send their daughters to school .
In countries where the family ’ s cost of schooling girls is lowered either by a no ##AT##-##AT## fee policy or by a stipend for girls who enroll in school , girls ’ enrollment rate increases .
The experiences of these few countries lead us to propose a system whereby mothers are paid if their school ##AT##-##AT## age daughters attend school regularly from the 3rd to the 9th grade .
This would increase girls ’ enrollment and also put money into women ’ s hands – important because studies show that money given to women is more likely to provide positive nutritional and health benefits for their children than money given to men .
It also provides the women with greater bargaining power in their own households .
The annual cost per pupil would be $ 32 .
Covering every eligible girl in sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan Africa and South Asia for a year would cost $ 6 billion .
Benefits from increased future wages and the reduction in health ##AT##-##AT## care use would be between three and 26 times higher .
Pregnancy is one of the most vulnerable times for poor women ; 99 % of the 529,000 women who die annually from pregnancy ##AT##-##AT## related complications live in developing countries .
Severe malnutrition and the absence of prenatal care during pregnancy put both mother and child at serious risk .
Spending $ 3.9 billion on family planning and maternal health initiatives , such as provision of emergency contraception in sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan Africa and South Asia , could avert 1.4 million infant deaths and 142,000 pregnancy ##AT##-##AT## related deaths in women .
Making reproductive services available to women who cannot afford to pay their way can help prevent these deaths .
But such services must not shy away from promoting and providing modern contraceptive methods to avoid unwanted pregnancies .
Nearly 20 % of women in developing countries report that they would like to stop having more children but are not using any form of contraception or family planning , possibly because reproductive services are not available .
For adolescent girls , early marriage or an unwanted pregnancy typically curtails schooling .
Delaying marriage and childbearing allows them to gain more education and perhaps more earning opportunities , as well as improved health , education , and labor market success for their future children – benefits worth ten times more than the cost of providing reproductive services .
Other tools , aside from schooling , can help women improve their income ##AT##-##AT## earning ability .
Microfinance institutions , such as Bangladesh ’ s Grameen Bank , play a vital role in allowing self ##AT##-##AT## employed women to build profitable businesses .
Small loans empower women by giving them more control over household assets and resources , more autonomy and decision ##AT##-##AT## making power , and greater access to participation in public life .
Women are more likely than men to meet regular repayments and to spend their earnings on children ’ s health and education .
Policymakers should continue to facilitate the rollout of microfinance programs .
Studies show that each dollar loaned by a microfinance institution increases household expenditure by almost 10 % in the first year , and that the benefits will continue for another 30 years . Benefits are estimated to end up about six times higher than the costs .
Though women have the right to vote in almost every country , gender inequalities in political representation remain large .
Governments should consider gender quotas at the local level of politics .
Greater female representation may not necessarily lead to more emphasis on “ female ” policy priorities , but in India , village councils with gender quotas for village chiefs have higher levels of safe drinking water , better immunization coverage and roads , and less bribery .
There may be some losses from electing women because they tend to have less political experience than men , but the record in India suggests that if it took 20 years to establish a 30 % share of women in local positions in other countries , the benefits would be at least double the costs of achieving this .
Being a woman need not and should not be among the greatest challenges of life .
COPENHAGEN – The past decade has proven again and again that empowering women worldwide holds the key to solving many seemingly intractable issues that have otherwise stymied policymakers .
Poverty in the developing world seemed ineradicable until micro ##AT##-##AT## lenders saw millions of low ##AT##-##AT## income , destitute women as potential entrepreneurs .
Involving African women in decision ##AT##-##AT## making about crop production turns out to enable environmentally sustainable farming practices .
Runaway population growth becomes controllable when women have access to literacy and business opportunities as well as to contraception .
Could the tensions and conflicts surrounding the issue of immigration in Europe be yet another issue for which the empowerment of women holds a solution ?
In a recent visit to Copenhagen to commemorate International Women ’ s Day , I took part in many conversations that duplicate others throughout Europe : citizens from across the political spectrum were struggling with the issue of non ##AT##-##AT## European immigration and the cultural tensions that have ensued .
What does it mean to be Danish , German , or French in the presence of these millions of newcomers , most of whom come from non ##AT##-##AT## democratic societies ?
Some of this anxiety is pure racism ; but some is not .
What would “ integration ” mean , and how is it achieved without the loss of cherished civil ##AT##-##AT## society values ?
These are not necessarily xenophobic questions : a post ##AT##-##AT## enlightenment civil society , with a free press and due process , is a precious thing , and those values should not be sacrificed to politically correct moral relativism .
This issue has been given new urgency by the arrests in Ireland of alleged jihadists from several countries who are accused of plotting to murder a Swedish cartoonist who drew an image of the prophet Mohammed as a dog .
Across Europe , the discussions are growing more intense as anti ##AT##-##AT## immigration platforms gain supporters in otherwise liberal countries , from Germany to France to traditionally inclusive and tolerant Denmark itself .
Then I witnessed the prototype of a true solution .
I met Elisabeth Møller Jensen , the director of KVINFO , “ the Danish center for information on gender , equality and ethnicity ” – an extraordinary organization funded by Denmark ’ s Ministry of Culture .
One of its many innovative programs is already showing results in terms of genuinely integrating immigrant families into Danish society .
By addressing immigrant women – and by viewing them as potential leaders , rather than as quiescent potential maids or service workers – KVINFO is enabling their families to witness the benefits of an open civil society in their own lives .
KVINFO began a “ mentor network ” aimed at immigrant and refugee women in 2002 .
By 2010 , it had 5,000 participants , had won awards and international acclaim for best integrative practices , and is being replicated throughout Denmark – and observers are exploring programs or partnerships modeled upon it in Canada , Spain , Portugal , and Norway .
The program pairs refugee and immigrant women in a one ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## one mentoring relationship with women who are established leaders at all levels of Danish society .
The pairing is not cursory .
A careful matchmaking process unites the interests and goals of the women on both sides , and already has paid amazing dividends .
Women who were journalists , engineers , or scientists in their countries of origin – and who could not get jobs as checkout cashiers in Denmark – have been paired with Danish counterparts and are now back in school , or working in research .
But even women who arrive with no higher education or professional skills create an “ action plan . ”
They learn from their mentors what options there are , how to proceed , and what to do to reach their objectives . As they enter the workforce , their language skills improve , their household income soars , and their children see firsthand a woman in a respected , economically valued role .
Their loved ones thus learn how to thrive in a European context – occasionally coming to KVINFO events and benefiting from their mothers ’ expanding network of contacts .
So , rather than feeling exploited and condemned indefinitely to the fringes of a Northern European society – and thus vulnerable to the stirrings of demagogues and extremists – these women ’ s children grow up fully familiar with Danish civil society , well informed about higher education and professional opportunities , and hopeful rather than cynical .
By empowering women , the whole family is lifted up and , in a supportive rather than a colonizing way , “ Europeanized ” in the best sense .
I am often struck by the way many Europeans use arms ##AT##-##AT## length euphemisms when talking about immigrants : they want immigrants to feel “ welcome ” or “ comfortable . ”
I always wonder , “ But do you want them to feel French , or German , or Norwegian ? ”
To be fully integrated , Muslim and other newcomers to European countries must be welcomed not as perpetual visitors – even if , ideally , as nicely treated visitors – but rather as family members , as the American model does ( or aspires to do ) .
As Møller Jensen put it , “ I want these children to feel Danish . ” These young people and Denmark itself will benefit , as this “ KVINFO generation ” grows up with a genuine stake in Danish civil society , and seeing the world as Danes , not as guests .
What will G ##AT##-##AT## 8 summit meetings be like when American President Hillary Clinton and French President Ségolène Royal join German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a formidable triangle of women ’ s power ?
The scenario is not altogether unlikely .
Indeed , in the United States and France , there are even alternative female candidates for the presidency ( Condoleezza Rice in America , Michelle Alliot ##AT##-##AT## Marie in France ) .
Will this mean a new style of both domestic politics and international relations ?
The answer is not obvious .
After all , some women have long had the strength and the will to make it to the top .
Think of Indira Gandhi , Golda Meir , or Margaret Thatcher .
All three were powerful prime ministers of their countries , though perhaps not the epitome of what might be regarded as feminine values .
They all outdid men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called feminism .
Indeed , another trend may be more significant as far as political leadership is concerned .
When it comes to the formation of governments , women have managed to break out of the prison of their traditional domains , such as education and social affairs .
Foreign policy in particular has become a female aspiration .
Both the US and the European Union have women leading their foreign offices ; so do half a dozen EU countries , including Britain .
Has this changed the style , indeed , the substance of foreign policy ?
Undoubtedly , a shift in policy styles is occurring in many parts of the world .
In a word , it appears that the Reagan ##AT##-##AT## Thatcher period is over .
While opponents of globalization still fight “ neo ##AT##-##AT## liberal ” policies , political discourse has taken a new turn .
Words like “ justice ” are back in fashion ; there is concern about globalization ’ s losers and the “ underclass . ”
Likewise , the leader of Britain ’ s Conservatives , David Cameron , startled more old ##AT##-##AT## fashioned supporters of his party by saying that people released from prison “ need , above all , love . ” When Prime Minister Tony Blair described the next election as a fistfight in which the “ flyweight ” Cameron would be carried out and the “ heavyweight ” Brown victorious after a short bout , he got much applause from his supporters in the House of Commons , but the remark went down badly with voters .
Somehow , people prefer “ softer ” values than were prevalent in the last two decades .
Yet it is not the leading women who above all represent these values .
Merkel may have been softened by having to preside over a grand coalition , but her original stance was more of the Reagan ##AT##-##AT## Thatcher variety .
Yuliya Tymoshenko was clearly the most stouthearted among the leaders of Ukraine ’ s Orange Revolution , and no one has ever described Hillary Clinton as particularly “ soft . ”
On the contrary , her possible Republican opponent in 2009 , Senator John McCain , while a war hero , is also a man who represents to many Americans the new soft values .
Merkel had a difficult time in the run ##AT##-##AT## up to her recent party conference , because Jürgen Rüttgers , the minister ##AT##-##AT## president of the largest German state , North ##AT##-##AT## Rhine Westphalia , reminded the Christian Democrats of their historical support for strong social ##AT##-##AT## welfare policies .
Only Royal may be said to represent softer lines against the hard ##AT##-##AT## liner of the governing party , Nicolas Sarkozy .
So , have women at or near the top made no real difference to politics ?
Whatever change they have brought has not been obvious .
In a sense , women ’ s advance is simply the normal consequence of the gradual move to effective equality of opportunity that began in the 1960 ’ s .
It took decades to become real , and there are still countries that have a long way to go .
Despite Tymoshenko ’ s leading role in Ukraine , it would be surprising to see Russian President Vladimir Putin replaced by a woman , and , while there is a female vice ##AT##-##AT## president in China , there is no sign of a woman becoming Japanese prime minister soon .
Even so , in many parts of the world , women have made considerable headway on the path to the top .
Not infrequently this has been helped by explicit policies .
David Cameron prides himself on a successful campaign to make 40 % of all Conservative parliamentary candidates in Britain are women .
But this is precisely the point .
It is not the women at the top who have changed the scene .
Rather , it is a more general trend , helped along by open ##AT##-##AT## minded leaders of both sexes , that has changed the political climate in countries .
No one , man or woman , can today aspire to setting the tone of public discourse without recognizing that politics is no longer only a man ’ s game .
In other words , normalization by equal opportunity is itself the change .
Whatever the particular values of leading candidates , this is undoubtedly progress .
The last annualized figure for labor protests that Beijing was willing to announce publicly was 100,000 for the year 1999 .
But a 2001 internal report from the Ministry of Public Security disclosed that the numbers &quot; began a rise like a violent wind &quot; from 1997 , the year of the Communist Party &apos;s Fifteenth Congress , which pressed for factory firings in the name of &quot; efficiency . &quot;
While the government is determined to keep news of all disturbances out of the media--or at least downplay their size and disruptiveness--it has been possible to collect information on nearly 200 separate events occurring between 1994 and 2004 , some from news sources in Hong Kong , some from the Western media , and a few from Chinese publications .
They all exhibit the same , unchanging pattern : the government , whether in Beijing or the localities , tolerates the low ##AT##-##AT## decibel , smaller ##AT##-##AT## scale , relatively non ##AT##-##AT## disruptive marches and sit ##AT##-##AT## ins by demonstrators bearing petitions and posters , especially if they appear to be spontaneous , un ##AT##-##AT## organized , localized and leaderless .
The incidents loom substantially more dangerous to the political elite if they seem to have been mobilized by dissidents , are marked by some measure of violence , threaten to spread , or entail the obstruction of major transport trunklines .
Indeed , the episodes that make it into the media beyond the Mainland are usually such protests .
What is sparking so much unrest in a country usually depicted as daily growing more affluent ? Generally the causes are these : unpaid wages and pensions ; sudden and massive job terminations ; and management corruption held responsible for the bankruptcy of industrial enterprises--where discharged workers were secure , enjoying privileges and benefits , since the 1950s .
Job losses in the range of 60 million have suddenly rendered nearly an eighth of the urban populace indigent . Often without a dependable channel for airing their grievances , hordes of laid ##AT##-##AT## off workers and retired folk have filled the avenues over the past decade or so .
Doesn &apos;t the government mind if so much of its urban populace is sinking into poverty and becoming disaffected ? Why is this stability ##AT##-##AT## obsessed regime allowing so much instability ?
In fact , the leaders are terribly uneasy about the situation and discuss it frequently . Some of the response has been coldly coercive .
But there is also a compensatory effort that has absorbed much of the energy of the bureaucracies for labor and social security , and for civil affairs .
For 2004 , the central government allocated some 78 billion yuan for laid ##AT##-##AT## off workers and the poor , with localities also upping their outlays . But the sad truth is that probably only about a quarter of those pushed out of their plants ever received assistance .
For those who have , however , this policy has nipped discontent in the bud .
Additionally , there have been attempts to create new posts , develop labor ##AT##-##AT## intensive industries and small and medium sized firms , promote the private sector , and encourage service jobs , plus offering occupational training : the government allocated an additional 4.7 billion yuan expressly for job creation in 2004 .
These policies mitigate the pain of job loss for their recipients .
Promotion of the law also aims at alleviating anger . As workers &apos; consciousness of their rights increases , they are gradually more and more apt to appeal grievances to the courts : from 1995 to 2001 , adjudicated labor disputes rose from 28,000 to 101,000 .
Offering workers legal redress has turned their attention temporarily from the streets to mediation and may well have reduced the number of street demonstrations .
Other initiatives are a program of allowances , training and placement for the laid ##AT##-##AT## off ; unemployment insurance ( which , unfortunately , depends on the economic health of the firm to which a worker was once attached ) ; and pension reform--having similar problems .
There is also a scheme to supply a &quot; minimum livelihood guarantee &quot; to the desperately poor .
Recipients numbered over 20 million as of early 2004 , when 15 billion yuan was budgeted for the program ( with the central government contributing a full 60 % ) . These programs are noticed at the grassroots , with the indigent feeling grateful for them .
Protest in China has spun upward dramatically in recent years , in numbers , scale , and organization . But by the means listed above the regime has become adept at suppressing opposition .
But overall , increasing responsiveness--if clearly not in a democratic mode--has managed to maintain the instability that does exist at a level and within a scope that marks a game of unwritten rules -- one of complainants confining their choler within understood bounds and of the government watchful over an ever ##AT##-##AT## simmering stew .
CAMBRIDGE &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; Will the political resurgence of labor unions throw a wrench into the wheels of globalization ?
Or will their growing strength serve to make globalization more sustainable by fostering great equality and fairness ?
One way or the other , unions stand as a major wild card for the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond .
Unions ’ rising influence is evident in many recent events : German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for postal employees ; several American presidential candidates ’ open misgivings about trade and immigration ; and the Chinese leadership ’ s nascent concerns about labor standards .
Along with their political clout , unions ’ intellectual respectability is also experiencing a renaissance .
After decades of vilification by economists for raising unemployment and strangling growth , the union movement is now receiving backing from thought leaders such as Paul Krugman , who argues that stronger unions are needed to counter globalization ’ s worst excesses .
The sudden emergence of unions as a political force is particularly surprising in the United States , where private ##AT##-##AT## sector union membership has fallen from 25 % in 1975 to 8 % today .
From high ##AT##-##AT## tech Google to mass retailer Wal ##AT##-##AT## Mart , US companies have found ways to keep their shops union ##AT##-##AT## free .
Only the public sector , where the membership rate is 35 % , has remained a union bastion .
One of my best friends from childhood married a union organizer who found it so difficult to land a job in the US that he eventually moved his family to strike ##AT##-##AT## happy Canada .
Today , US political leaders such as Congressman Barney Frank want to bring back unions .
But there is good reason to be skeptical .
For a relatively poor country like China , real unions could help balance employers ’ power , bringing quality ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## life benefits that outweigh the growth costs .
Factory conditions in parts of China are all too reminiscent of the early twentieth ##AT##-##AT## century , pre ##AT##-##AT## union US .
Thousands of Chinese workers die each year in coal mines that sometimes lack basic safety precautions .
But , for the US and rich countries in Europe , the argument that stronger unions would bring more benefits than costs is far more dubious .
Nowadays , most workers already have legal and statutory rights that cover the basic protections that unions originally fought for a century ago .
Instead , union influence today all too often serves to promulgate inflexible work practices and flat salary structures that do not adequately reward work effort and skill .
It is no surprise that the public sector , where productivity is low and fiscal constraints soft , typically has the greatest union concentration .
Teachers ’ unions , especially , are a catastrophe , blocking any rationalization or improvement of many countries ’ education systems .
Before the modern globalization era , unions could thrive by organizing on a national scale , giving them enormous bargaining power vis ##AT##-##AT## à-vis both employers and consumers .
Now , after the explosive post ##AT##-##AT## war expansion of global trade , most unions have seen their monopoly power eroded , if not shattered .
That is why unions throughout much of the developed world have been fighting so hard to block free ##AT##-##AT## trade negotiations that might erode their position further .
Some of the issues that unions are promoting , such as human rights and environmental quality , are unassailable .
When they try to connect these issues with trade , however , their motives become questionable .
A case in point is union lobbying against the US ##AT##-##AT## Colombia free ##AT##-##AT## trade agreement , ratification of which would greatly advance US ##AT##-##AT## Latin American relations .
Legitimate questions about how the Colombian government conducted its epic civil war with drug ##AT##-##AT## financed rebels do not trump broader issues .
So anti ##AT##-##AT## pact activists have complained that Colombia is anti ##AT##-##AT## union because it does not protect union members from rebel violence .
Yet the Colombian government notes that all Colombians suffer from rebel violence – union members actually experience less of it than the rest of the population .
Unfortunately , this play is being re ##AT##-##AT## enacted across a host of trade issues , including many involving China .
For rich countries , income redistribution is much better handled through taxes and benefits system , rather than by government edicts to strengthen unions .
The rich today pay so little in taxes in many countries , that it would be a big improvement simply to move to a flat tax , with a very high exemption level so that lower ##AT##-##AT## income families pay nothing .
For middle ##AT##-##AT## income countries , it is a tougher call .
But here , too , increasing workers ’ legal and statutory rights , while allowing most unions to fade away , seems like the right approach .
Unfortunately , we are far more likely to see unions ’ growing political influence become a major destabilizing force in trade and growth , with highly uncertain consequences .
When we see political leaders in many rich countries pander to unions by bashing each other on free trade and immigration , there is every reason to worry about trouble ahead .
That is why unions will be one of the main economic wild cards in 2008 .
The euphoria of fans whose team wins a major sporting event is ephemeral .
But , prominent professors at Korean universities tell me that the unprecedented success of the Korean team in the current World Cup competition is causing a turning point in Korean attitudes towards their own society and economy .
Why ?
Many Koreans , especially those who studied or lived in the West , complain about the &quot; cronyism &quot; , and the resulting importance of &quot; connections &quot; in all walks of Korean life , which they see as pervasive features of Korean society .
They claim that such rampant cronyism is preventing Korea from catching up economically with the West , despite the fact that Korea soon will have as much human capital as western countries .
To understand Korean cronyism we have to see it as one aspect of a set of related social conventions .
Koreans accept a sense of knowing one &apos;s place in society that seems extreme to Americans .
In social interactions , and also in business dealings , Koreans maintain a hierarchy that seems to weigh age more highly than performance .
Also , although admission to elite universities is as meritocratic in Korea as in the West , the outcome of the university entrance competition has a more important and more permanent effect on one &apos;s place in Korean society .
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that in America people have to prove themselves continually , whereas in traditional Korean society people have only to prove themselves once , then they can be set for life due in large measure to the network of crony contacts that initial success will have provided .
What do Korean cronyism and related social conventions have to do with the World Cup ?
In the past cronyism apparently has been as pervasive in the selection of Korean teams for international sports competitions as in other areas of Korean society .
But , two years ago when the Korean soccer football association hired the Dutchman , Guus Hiddink , to coach the Korean national soccer team , Hiddink made it clear that he would select his players based on merit alone .
The performance of the Korean team in the 2002 World Cup competition is demonstrating to every Korean in a way that is easily seen that meritocracy yields better results than cronyism .
It also helps that Hiddink has been able to use his coaching skills to bring out in his team the strengths of the Korean national character : intelligence , discipline , tenacity , and perseverance .
Of course , Korean traditionalists reject criticism of what westernized Koreans call cronyism .
Traditionalists argue that criticism of cronyism is really criticism of social solidarity and responsibility , which they see as positive features of Korean society .
Traditionalists also argue that meritocracy implies individualism , and that too much individualism and too little social solidarity and responsibility are negative features of western society .
Some traditionalists even might claim that they do not want Koreans to be as rich as westerners if that requires Koreans to be as individualistic as westerners .
The Hiddink phenomenon did not emerge suddenly out of thin air .
The accumulation of gradual changes that have already occurred in Korean society made it acceptable to import a westerner to coach the Korean national soccer team and to allow him to establish a meritocratic regime .
But Hiddink has expedited the process of change within Korean society , and his success has made it look revolutionary .
It remains to be seen how fast , in what ways , and with what effects , Korean society will continue to change .
Koreans are talking about learning the lessons of Hiddink . But the western model of a meritocratic society is not easy to emulate .
A soccer team is a relatively simple organization .
Implementing the lessons of Hiddink throughout Korean society will present more difficult challenges .
Whatever the outcome , it seems that in the case of the 2002 World Cup the effects of success in a major sporting event will not be ephemeral .
Macroeconomic policies , financial globalization , and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades , not only in income and wealth , but also in access to education , healthcare , social protection , as well as in political participation and influence .
Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth , an array of factors , exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes , has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge , social responsibility , and life chances from one generation to the next .
As surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament , few countries , rich or poor , have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality , or to its consequences for education , health , and social welfare .
Of course , there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence .
But inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability , threatening security .
Excluded and facing bleak life prospects , young people , in particular , often experience anomie and may turn to anti ##AT##-##AT## social behavior , including violence .
Nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty .
Clearly , however , poverty arises from various complex conditions , and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach .
It is hard to imagine , for example , how to “ make poverty history ” without also generating enough decent work , educational opportunities , and healthcare for all .
To be sure , the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades .
Access to education for girls has improved , and some gender gaps have been reduced .
Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis , life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems .
Overall , however , the inequality gaps are large and , in many cases , growing .
The most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality , with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries .
Meanwhile , growing unemployment , widening skill and productivity gaps , and the “ informalization ” or “ casualization ” of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide , as the number of “ working poor ” and the incidence of “ jobless growth ” has spread .
Nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs , imposed since the 1980 ’ s , delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth .
Growth in much of the world during the past quarter ##AT##-##AT## century has been slower than in the previous 25 years , despite more rapid growth in East Asia , India , and a few other countries .
Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally .
But inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years , largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels .
Indeed , in much of the world , such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government , while otherwise increasing overall inequalities .
The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions .
But they are exceptions : the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries , with rising unemployment , greater earnings disparities , reduced social protection , and environmental degradation .
International financial liberalization , for example , has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities .
In addition , contrary to the promises of its proponents , financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital ##AT##-##AT## poor to the capital ##AT##-##AT## rich over the long term , while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity .
Meanwhile , free ##AT##-##AT## trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends .
Developing countries ’ international terms of trade have worsened : prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures , as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture , and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights .
As a result , trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de ##AT##-##AT## industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world , as in the case of garments this year .
And , while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries , the main beneficiaries will be the more well ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## do agricultural exporters .
Countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off .
The “ retreat of the state ” in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government , including the capacity to lead and sustain development , as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education , health , housing , and utilities .
The economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start , and its consequences have become glaringly obvious .
Unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction , the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart .
COPENHAGEN – Tens of thousands of people will soon gather in Rio de Janeiro for the United Nations Earth Summit .
The participants , ranging from weary politicians to enthusiastic campaigners , are supposed to reignite global concern for the environment .
Unfortunately , the summit is likely to be a wasted opportunity .
The UN is showcasing the alluring promise of a “ green economy , ” focused on tackling global warming .
In fact , the summit is striking at the wrong target , neglecting the much greater environmental concerns of the vast majority of the world .
Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat .
Even if we assumed – unreasonably – that it caused all deaths from floods , droughts , heat waves , and storms , this total would amount to just 0.06 % of all deaths in developing countries .
In comparison , 13 % of all Third World deaths result from water and air pollution .
So , for each person who might die from global warming , about 210 people die from health problems that result from a lack of clean water and sanitation , from breathing smoke generated by burning dirty fuels ( such as dried animal dung ) indoors , and from breathing polluted air outdoors .
By focusing on measures to prevent global warming , the advanced countries might help to prevent many people from dying .
That sounds good until you realize that it means that 210 times as many people in poorer countries might die needlessly as a result – because the resources that could have saved them were spent on windmills , solar panels , biofuels , and other rich ##AT##-##AT## world fixations .
But of course , poor countries ’ tangible pollution problems are not trendy , and they do not engage outspoken campaigners , media , and governments the way that global warming can .
Nowhere are the failed priorities better illustrated than in the UN ’ s official , colorful “ Rio + 20 ” leaflet .
Here , the UN helpfully provides a layman ’ s explanation of the summit , along with examples of its envisioned “ green economy ” in action .
We see scary pictures of dry riverbeds ( the result of global warming ) , along with plenty of pretty solutions like wind turbines and solar panels .
The problem is that green energy mostly is still much more expensive , less effective , and more intermittent than the alternatives .
Yet , the summit literature claims that it will boost economic growth and eradicate poverty .
But seriously , why do well ##AT##-##AT## meaning First Worlders think that the Third World should have energy technologies that are more expensive , feebler , and less reliable than their own ?
Without a hint of irony , the leaflet is called “ The Future We Want . ” But , in a world where a billion people go to bed hungry , and where six million die each year from air and water pollution , most of those in the developing world likely have a very different set of priorities for their future .
The leaflet cheerfully claims that China ’ s shift “ to a low ##AT##-##AT## carbon growth strategy based on the development of renewable energy sources &#91; has &#93; created jobs , income , and revenue . ”
In fact , over the past 25 years , China has quadrupled its CO2 emissions .
While China does produce about half of the world ’ s solar panels , 98 % are exported to reap generous subsidies from rich ##AT##-##AT## world markets .
Only 0.005 % of China ’ s energy comes from solar panels .
China ’ s decades ##AT##-##AT## long economic expansion has lifted 600 million people out of poverty , but the enormous pollution that this has entailed does not fit into Rio + 20 ’ s green narrative .
Likewise , the brochure explains that some farmers in Uganda have embraced organic farming .
Unfortunately , Africa is almost entirely organic now – leading to low yields , hunger , and deforestation .
Africa needs to boost its yields , and that means enabling farmers to use modern crops , fertilizers , and pesticides .
Producing less with more effort might appeal to well ##AT##-##AT## fed First Worlders , but it is literally starving the poor .
Reading further , the leaflet gushes that France has created 90,000 jobs in the green economy . But the stark reality remains hidden : the average cost of each green job is more than $ 200,000 per year , which French taxpayers patently cannot afford .
And economic models show that France has lost as many or more jobs because of the extra costs of the subsidies .
Adding insult to injury , a beautiful photograph shows electric cars finishing the “ Zero Emissions Race ” in Geneva . Omitted is the fact that most electricity still comes from burning fossil fuels , so the cars are anything but “ zero ” emissions .
And , more importantly , most of our planet ’ s inhabitants still dream of owning some form of mechanized transport – which is unlikely to be an electric vehicle with a price tag of $ 50,000 or more .
In a world plagued by serious problems caused by air and water pollution , this breezy focus on trendy topics and unrealistic solutions is deeply disturbing .
A disconnected global elite is flying to Rio to tell the world ’ s poor to have a solar panel .
Rather than pandering to advanced countries ’ obsessions , Rio + 20 could do more good for humanity – and the planet – by focusing on the top environmental problems and their simple solutions .
BEIJING – On November 15 Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the CCP ’ s Central Military Commission , giving him supreme authority over China ’ s armed forces .
Next March , he will become President of China as well .
How does China ’ s new leader see the world , and how will he handle the country ’ s foreign policy ?
Do his style and preferences differ significantly from those of his predecessor , Hu Jintao ?
The answers will determine China ’ s relations with the world , and vice versa , for the next decade .
China ’ s leaders approach power in a very different way than do political leaders in , say , the United States .
American politicians must sell their ideas and values to voters ; China ’ s leaders do not need to inform the press and the public directly about anything , including their foreign ##AT##-##AT## policy positions .
Indeed , with the notable exceptions of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping , China ’ s leaders have seldom imposed their own personalities upon Chinese diplomacy .
In this sense , Xi ’ s leadership style will most likely continue in the tradition of his predecessors .
Nevertheless , Xi ’ s outlook and worldview are surely different from Hu ’ s .
For starters , Xi is part of a generation raised and educated mostly in China ’ s reform era , which has been a decisive influence in their lives .
China opened itself to the world in 1978 , when Xi and his contemporaries were young men eager to understand the world outside China .
They are a generation inspired by Deng ’ s realistic approach to shattering the walls that radical leftists had built around China , and one that believes that knowledge can change the destiny of the country and its people .
When this generation assumes the mantle of leadership , its members will turn their passion and curiosity about knowledge and innovation into real work .
They are surely willing to learn from the wider world as they seek to promote China ’ s national interests abroad and encourage gradual change at home .
Xi may address Chinese diplomacy ’ s thorniest issues – particularly Sino ##AT##-##AT## US relations – with more realism and flexibility than in recent years .
His visit to the US in February 2012 was widely regarded as a sequel to Deng ’ s visit in January 1979 .
Xi talked to President Barack Obama and visited the Pentagon . He gave a luncheon speech and saw old friends from his brief stay in Iowa as a young man .
He showed interest in American culture , just as Deng did in 1979 .
He ate chocolate and watched NBA games .
Most important , instead of spending countless hours drearily discussing political and strategic topics , he spoke directly and vigorously about the current state of Sino ##AT##-##AT## US relations . “ The Pacific Ocean is wide enough to accommodate the two major countries of China and the US , ” he declared .
Unhappy with America ’ s “ pivot ” to Asia , Xi remained calm , but emphasized that “ one cannot rely too much on military power regarding Asia ##AT##-##AT## Pacific diplomacy . ”
Similarly , Xi tried to avoid major arguments on human rights , saying simply , “ There ’ s no best , only better . ” In essence , he sought to demonstrate that however many questions , arguments , and even potential conflicts exist between China and the US , both countries ’ leaders should address them with an attitude of cooperation and sincerity .
Leaders should not become entangled in details that fuel suspicion of their counterparts ’ motives , lest they lose sight of the bigger picture .
Xi ’ s confidence extends to China ’ s domestic politics .
His generation is more certain of reform than previous leadership cohorts were , owing less to official ideology than to the country ’ s enormous achievements in the last three decades .
In practice , Xi may well prove to be a nationalist ; certainly , his generation , like the founding fathers of the People ’ s Republic , dreams of turning China into a stronger , more prosperous country .
The country ’ s new leaders want the world ’ s applause , but they are more eager for domestic ovations .
Like previous Chinese leaders , Xi firmly believes that the world should respect China ’ s authority to manage its own affairs .
Thus , he is willing to show diplomatic muscle if China is challenged on a core area of concern .
His speech in Mexico in 2009 demonstrated this . “ Some foreigners with full bellies and nothing better to do engage in finger ##AT##-##AT## pointing at us , ” he said .
“ First , China does not export revolution ; second , it does not export famine and poverty ; and , third , it does not mess around with you .
So what else is there to say ? ”
Xi understands that the world expects not only a better China , but also a China that is committed to constructing a better world .
He will be a tough and strong ##AT##-##AT## minded leader , but one who understands the world in a pragmatic way and knows how to work well with his foreign counterparts .
Indeed , his 2012 visit to the US left two impressions .
First , he is a leader at ease both in front of and away from the television cameras .
Second , he is not afraid to have a little fun .
With those simple touches of humanity , Xi could bring a revolution to China ’ s diplomacy .
NEW YORK – In October 2010 , the current brothers of George W. Bush ’ s former fraternity at Yale , Delta Kappa Epsilon , marched through the first ##AT##-##AT## year quad chanting , “ No means yes !
Yes means anal ! ” They held up signs reading , “ We love Yale Sluts . ”
Sixteen graduate and undergraduate students , male and female , felt that the university ’ s administration then did little to push back against such encroachments on female students ’ rights to a fair and non ##AT##-##AT## threatening learning environment .
In March , they filed a federal lawsuit against Yale , alleging that its “ failure to address incidents of sexual harassment and sexual assault has created a ‘ hostile environment . ’ ”
The lawsuit did not stop with the DKE incident .
First ##AT##-##AT## year women were ranked on their sex appeal , the complaint noted , and , most seriously , Yale failed to respond adequately to reports of sexual assault or attempted assault and stalking .
According to Alexandra Brodsky , a Yale junior and one of the 16 complainants , the students are “ really frustrated and disappointed that Yale again and again fails to respond to both public and private acts of sexual harassment and assaults , which … perpetuates an environment in which these … acts are okay . ”
The students ’ complaint coincides with a federal investigation by the Department of Education ’ s Office for Civil Rights , which announced that it would review Yale ’ s policies for dealing with sexual harassment and sexual assault .
This is no small matter : Yale and other American universities receive millions of federal dollars annually – money that would be jeopardized if the university was found to tolerate an unequal learning environment .
In 2004 , I wrote an article for New York magazine about my own experience of having been sexually encroached upon as a third ##AT##-##AT## year undergraduate at Yale by an esteemed professor ( the crime of “ sexual harassment ” had not yet been codified ) .
I wrote , too , about Yale ’ s cover ##AT##-##AT## up of many situations like mine .
So the students ’ lawsuit was not surprising to me .
Indeed , in the course of trying to report to the university in 2004 what had happened to me in 1983 , I found the same pattern of stonewalling victims and defending perpetrators .
Worse still , I discovered that the university and its lawyers used the sexual harassment “ grievance procedure ” as a screen to protect the institution , its harassers , and even its rapists , rather than as a means to investigate incidents of abuse .
This situation had persisted for two decades .
As I conducted my reporting , I heard woman after woman allege that the same professor or the same fraternity had engaged in multiple instances of assault or harassment .
Victim after victim would plead , heartbreakingly , “ Help me . ”
But I could do nothing , because the women chose to remain anonymous , and because the university treated each case as top secret .
Alleged perpetrators were free to teach in a new university – where more young women ( and in some cases , young men ) would become their prey .
Compounding the lack of transparency , Yale maintains its own campus police force , to which sex ##AT##-##AT## crime victims are encouraged to report their complaints if they insist upon formal documentation .
But victims often do not understand that this actually tends to contain potentially embarrassing scandals , by preventing real – that is , accountable – law enforcement from getting involved .
Indeed , there have been disclosed to me reports of at least three alleged sex assaults by faculty or academic staff in the past decade – two alleged incidents reported by two different women involving the same man .
I know that one undergraduate has more recently pursued legal action against a staff member , who , she said , drugged her with Rohypnol , the “ date rape ” drug , and assaulted her .
I know these accounts , but I can ’ t report them , even at this critical moment in the long ##AT##-##AT## overdue formal investigation , because of confidentiality protocols .
Each of these women feels alone .
Like virtually every private university in the United States , Yale has relied on “ privacy ” to keep these incidents under wraps , so that incoming women ( and men ) have no idea who among the faculty or students is dangerous ; which fraternity is a site of repeated harassment or worse ; and when to keep the door open on a student ##AT##-##AT## teacher meeting .
Like the Catholic Church , private universities like Yale can use victims ’ shame and isolation to disenfranchise them and to protect the perpetrators .
But I believe that the victims themselves have a responsibility .
The convention of taking sex ##AT##-##AT## crime testimony from alleged victims behind closed doors , under conditions of anonymity or confidentiality , only serves institutions like universities or the military that are intent on covering up criminal behavior .
Some feminists have attacked me for this position , but the numbers bear me out : thirty years ago , 30 % of reported rapes in the US and the United Kingdom resulted in prosecutions ; today , after three decades of confidential sex ##AT##-##AT## crime reporting , the number is 12 % in the US and 6 % in the UK .
This is largely because confidentiality in sex ##AT##-##AT## crime reporting prevents the media from shining a light on the crime , inhibits institutional memory of repeated assailants , and prevents scrutiny of whether a court , college , or police precinct is doing better or worse at handling such cases .
As a result , serious crimes can be swept under the rug – at Yale and at every other private US university I have ever visited ( public universities are less free to conceal crime data ) – in the guise of “ protecting the victims . ”
Yale alumnae are reportedly now contacting these 16 students with their own stories of sexual assault and harassment , spanning two decades .
But if they had come forward publicly years ago , it is likely that Yale could not have continued for so long to protect the sex criminals in its midst .
The students are right : a sexually abusive environment does make it harder for students to study and learn .
But victims – whether current students or alumnae – would be well advised to take a deep breath , come forward , and tell their stories out loud .
Only then would Yale and other institutions be forced to reckon publicly with a problem that has persisted for generations .
RIO DE JANEIRO – Last month , the leaders of all 12 countries of South America ( except one ) gathered in Quito , Ecuador ’ s capital , for the summit of the Union of South American Nations .
UNASUR or UNASUL ( depending on whether one speaks Spanish or Portuguese ) was established by the twelve presidents in Brasília in May 2008 with the aim of furthering economic and political integration .
Instead , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez hijacked the Quito meeting to propagate his Bolivarian Revolution and expound his own ideas for the continent ’ s future as independent of the United States .
Thanks to America ’ s recently announced military agreement with Colombia , Chávez ’ s ideas got more of a hearing than might have been expected .
For , instead of infrastructure plans , commercial or environmental treaties , or even multilateral action against such common problems as violence and poverty , the issue that dominated both press accounts and the speeches at the gathering was the new US ##AT##-##AT## Colombian military agreement , announced less than a month before the summit .
To no one ’ s surprise , Chávez dominated the criticism of the pact .
He claimed that the “ Winds of war are blowing , ” and that the announcement of the military agreement “ can transform itself into a tragedy . ”
Unfortunately , Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was absent from the meeting .
Colombia and Ecuador broke diplomatic relations in March 2008 , after Colombia ’ s army pursued FARC guerillas , who have been fighting Colombia ’ s government for decades , into Ecuadorean territory .
So Uribe could not defend the new military agreement .
This left the floor open to Chávez to isolate Colombia and preach against the US .
In a continent where anti ##AT##-##AT## Americanism remains both very popular and an effective way to consolidate national cohesion and political power , Chávez ’ s attacks found a ready audience .
In addition , Uribe ’ s absence allowed Chávez to avoid responding to Colombia ’ s accusations that Venezuela and its ally Ecuador support the narco ##AT##-##AT## Marxist FARC .
One week after the summit , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to calm the continent ’ s fears about the US ##AT##-##AT## Colombia agreement , explaining that it is merely a minor revision of the Bill Clinton ##AT##-##AT## era Plan Colombia , an American program to support the government against the drug cartels .
But her words did little soothing .
Nor did it seem to help that even most local military analysts say that the agreement does not represent any major change in the US military position on the continent .
The simple fact is that the timing of the announcement of the pact was terrible , and gave a platform for Bolivarian rants that will not be without consequences .
Indeed , the ongoing fallout is likely to remain very negative .
By raising anti ##AT##-##AT## American suspicions and strengthening Chávez ’ s position across the continent , the agreement weakens the influence of Brazil .
Recently , Brazil had been differentiating itself from the rest of the continent through its stable economy and vibrant democratic political system , both of which were helping the country ’ s poor .
So the spread and strengthening of Chávez ’ s so ##AT##-##AT## called Bolivarian Revolution was not in Brazil ’ s interests , even though some of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ’ s officials appear to be fans of Chávez and his administration .
The terrible timing of the US ##AT##-##AT## Colombia military agreement also gave Chávez and his allies a reason to build up their armies against the “ evil imperialist ianque . ”
After all , one must remember , the Bolivarian Revolution ’ s supposed “ enemy ” is the US , and no one else .
So the agreement may legitimize and produce an arms race in South America , which is in no one ’ s interest .
Another unexpected consequence of the US ##AT##-##AT## Colombia military agreement may be a further heightening of tensions between Venezuela and Colombia .
The radical polarization of the Andean region between those two countries will create difficulties in building regional consensus and security problems in the Amazon , as well as weakening the Brazilian project for South American political and economic integration .
Finally , another major consequence of the US ##AT##-##AT## Colombia deal are the doubts that it has created in Latin America about President Barack Obama ’ s administration , and about the future of relations between the US and South America , especially Brazil , the main regional power .
The agreement revived the perception that US diplomacy lacks sensitivity where the region is concerned .
If Obama wants to encourage moderate and democratic politics in South America , and to bolster Brazil ’ s efforts to foster stability and economic progress against the region ’ s radical and undemocratic forces , it must take greater care in not appearing to undermine those the US claims to support .
For Chávez is showing that the old cry of “ Yankee go home ” still resonates .
MOSCOW : The hardest thing about power is knowing when to let go .
The next hardest , particularly in a country like Russia which has experienced nothing but dictatorship for a millennium , is knowing whom to hand over power to .
In announcing his resignation on December 31 Boris Yeltsin may have succeeded on both counts , assuring not only his personal safety , but his place in history and Russia &apos;s infant democracy .
Yeltsin was more than the man who saved Russia in 1991 when a coup by communist hard ##AT##-##AT## liners threatened to turn back the clock by nullifying Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s perestroika and glasnost .
In nine muddy years since then Yeltsin also created a new Russia , very much in his own image : one unpredictable , wayward , but full of promise .
By stepping down now , Yeltsin has given his handpicked successor , acting president Vladimir Putin , the best chance to win elections that will take place this coming March .
Shades of Kremlin tsars and commissars of old ? As a deft manoeuvrer of the old school of communist politics , the gibe is tempting to apply to Yeltsin .
It is also unfair . With mandatory presidential elections next year , Moscow was awash in rumours : “ feeding time at the zoo ” as one British prime minister called it .
By ending the whispering campaign that he intended to cling to power no matter what , President Yeltsin deserves more cheers than jeers .
Through this orderly and constitutionally correct device to attempt to assure his succession , Yeltsin may have put paid to any possibility of a chaotic power struggle in the Kremlin without sacrificing democratic principles .
Russia may now go on to complete its transition from communism to capitalism .
But what do we know of the heir apparent , Vladimir Putin ?
In keeping with his shadowy KGB background , very little .
Putin is a married 46 year old , and a graduate of Saint Petersburg University &apos;s Law Faculty .
Stationed for a decade as a KGB agent in the former East Germany , he saw Western democratic and business practices at close hand , and is believed to be committed to them .
After communism &apos;s collapse , he worked with people like Anotoly Chubais in the liberal St. Petersburg government of the early 1990s .
Transferred to Moscow , he headed the FSB ( the transformed KGB ) until Yeltsin suddenly appointed him prime minister last August .
Despite his murky profile , Putin &apos;s most potent claim to fame – and to power – is a dour toughness .
In the bloody mountains and ruined cities of Chechnya , Putin established his credentials as the hard man Russia needs to restore order and stop the country &apos;s internal disintegration by revitalizing state power .
That the West seems nervous about Putin only enhances his prestige at home .
With Western economic policy prescriptions widely seen as having failed in Russia ; with NATO expanding near to the country &apos;s borders and old allies like Serbia bombed ; with America seen as wanting to weaken Russia even more , breaking it up into pieces and controlling the oil ##AT##-##AT## rich Caspian basin , anti ##AT##-##AT## western sentiments are on the rise .
President Putin &apos;s keen political antenna has caught this trend .
So the fact that the West eyes Russia &apos;s acting president with suspicion makes him even more desirable to the traditional Russian heart .
Vladimir Putin , however , prefers to promote the impression of his being a more enlightened and modern leader .
His prime ministerial new year &apos;s address – &quot; Russia at the Turn of the Millennium &quot; -- was posted on a Russian Government website for all the world to see before being published in Russian newspapers .
In it he outlined his presidential program : playing to the crowds , he declared that Russia is no plaything for the West to kick around .
But demagoguery stopped there . Russia , he also declared , must mend itself .
It will remain cooperative and friendly with the world , provided that the world is cooperative and friendly too .
But the hard work of rebuilding Russia must be done by Russians , and with no time to waste .
In Russia cultural instincts , in which communal ideas remain more valued than individualist principles , help determine the success or failure of policies .
The national strategies Putin will likely follow will take into account these social impulses .
Thus he is unlikely to publicly trumpet the unforgiving capitalist policies of Gaidar and Chubais , even if he quietly pursues them .
Undoubtedly a strong patriot , Putin also knows that Russia &apos;s national idea of itself must be cleansed of haughtiness and imperial ambitions .
Time and again he has said that Russia &apos;s national idea must blend traditional Russian concepts with a new , modern content .
The Russia he envisions will be a great power once more , but great in the ways that a truly modern society must be : in its democratic commitments , its economy , and its domestic tranquillity .
The consensus in Russia today is that Putin is a man of neither great talents nor great vices .
To ordinary Russians he appears as modest , principled , and honest – a vast contrast with the tainted politicians of the Yeltsin years .
He is a perfect fit for a Russia grown tired of the heroes , revolutionaries , criminals – even saviours – who make life exciting but rarely stable .
A recent poll showed that what Russia most wants is a new Brezhnev , whose 20 years ( 1964 ##AT##-##AT## 1982 ) of leadership first were disdained as an &quot; era of stagnation , &quot; but are now nostalgically recalled as the &quot; golden era of stagnation . &quot;
Putin fits the desired mould for a firmness and stolidity that ensures stability , a strong state , and a &quot; golden middle &quot; between radical reforms and strong ##AT##-##AT## arm rule .
In the back of their minds , however , Russians also hold a secret fear about Putin .
It concerns a man , a pleasant quiet individual who walks soundlessly through the Kremlin &apos;s corridors , someone who uncomplainingly takes on ( and completes ) many hard and unpleasant tasks neglected by others who fight noisily for high position .
Russians know that , one day , these unassuming political beasts of burden suddenly come out on top , as Stalin did in the early 1920s .
So of President Putin Russia , like history , must still reserve its judgement .
SANAA – When Yemen ’ s President Ali Abdullah Saleh ordered his military on March 18 to fire on peaceful protesters calling for his resignation , he sealed his fate .
A wave of military , government , and diplomatic defections , led by his long ##AT##-##AT## time ally First Armored Brigade Commander General Ali Muhsin al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar , rocked his regime .
But , although al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar announced that he was appalled by the use of force and vowed to defend the constitution , his decision was anything but altruistic .
The disgruntled general , who has long ##AT##-##AT## standing ties to the type of jihadists that the United States is battling in Yemen , merely sought to settle a score with the president ’ s family .
The relationship between al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar and Saleh extends to their youth , with Saleh ’ s mother having had a second marriage to al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar ’ s uncle .
Though they are not half ##AT##-##AT## brothers , this frequent , if mistaken reference , indicates their closeness .
Al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar has long been considered either Saleh ’ s right hand man or the country ’ s hidden president . When the Nasserite party attempted to overthrow Saleh less than 100 days into his presidency , al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar defended him and quashed the coup .
In 1994 , his units put down a secessionist movement in the south .
But , as Saleh prepared the way for his son Ahmad – the head of the Presidential Guard – to succeed him , he began to marginalize al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar .
In 2009 , Saleh sacked al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar ’ s key backers , including Central Command Chief General al ##AT##-##AT## Thahiri al ##AT##-##AT## Shadadi and Lieutenant General Haydar al ##AT##-##AT## Sanhani , from power .
Al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar has also not benefited from the military aid that the US lavished on Yemen in the wake of al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda ’ s failed Christmas Day plot in 2009 to down an American airliner .
While the Central Security Service , led by Saleh ’ s nephew Yahya , has received millions of dollars to fight al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar has been left out of the economic bonanza .
At the same time , al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar ’ s dismal performance in spearheading the war against the Houthi ##AT##-##AT## led sectarian rebellion in the north made him a convenient scapegoat for the regime ’ s failures .
The regime ’ s desire to get al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar out of the picture became clear during the last round of fighting aginst the Houthis in 2009 ##AT##-##AT## 2010 , when Saudi Arabia began bombing the rebels .
According to a US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks , Yemeni officials gave the Saudis the coordinates for al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar ’ s command center , telling them that it was a Houthi camp .
His relationship with Saleh frayed and his influence waning , al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar understood that his loyalty to Saleh had become a liability .
So his decision to abandon Saleh stemmed less from his love of the constitution and democracy than from his desire to even the score with the president and his son Ahmad Saleh , with whom he has long clashed .
Their units skirmished during the Houthi campaign , and the two engaged in a power struggle over defense of the radio and television stations .
Saleh won at the time , but today al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar ’ s troops have control .
Al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar ’ s relationship with jihadists is a source of serious concern .
He is married to the sister of Tariq al ##AT##-##AT## Fadhli , a Yemeni who fought alongside al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin in Afghanistan .
When more than 4,000 Arabs returned from fighting the Soviets there , al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar organized them into units and deployed them in the 1994 civil war .
One jihadist who trained in al ##AT##-##AT## Qaeda ’ s camps , and met bin Ladin , told me that upon his return from Afghanistan , he was invited to meet al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar ’ s associates and was given a monthly stipend .
During a 1999 trial of Yemenis convicted of kidnapping 16 Europeans , it emerged that the group ’ s ringleader called al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar during the ordeal .
Though his ties to jihadists may be expedient rather than ideological , they are deeply worrying .
Today , Saleh ’ s support among his top generals is dwindling .
Of Yemen ’ s four regional commanders , only Southern Command Chief General Mahdi Maqwala still backs him .
Lesser lieutenant generals have deserted the president in droves .
The fate of the country may not hinge on Saleh , a crafty veteran who knows that his career is over .
But his son Ahmad , who is less politically astute , may yet seek to settle accounts with al ##AT##-##AT## Ahmar .
His forces have already clashed with rival units in Mukalla and surrounded the presidential palace in Aden .
If the Salehs retain control of the air force , which remains under the control of Saleh ’ s half ##AT##-##AT## brother , employing it against defecting military divisions would likely lead to a bloodbath .
Nevertheless , the doomsday scenarios predicting anarchy and chaos in the post ##AT##-##AT## Saleh era are most likely exaggerated .
Unlike in Egypt , the vacuum resulting from Saleh ’ s departure can be quickly filled , so the country need not fall back on a military oligarchy .
The Yemeni opposition is not only organized , but also plays an active role in politics and has true grassroots support .
And , unlike in Egypt , where the ruling party was detested and out of touch with the masses , Yemen ’ s General People ’ s Congress has some following in society .
If Saleh leaves peacefully and represses the urge to unleash the last remaining loyal army units against protesters and defecting soldiers , the country can avert Libya ##AT##-##AT## like mayhem .
Indeed , the opposition parties have already organized a transitional council to take Saleh ’ s place .
With the sun quickly setting on the Saleh era , the president is out of options .
The only decision before him and his thinning ranks of allies is whether to leave peacefully or go down fighting .
For some time , scientists have believed that individual human beings were 99.9 % genetically identical . The 0.1 % of the genome that was different ( approximately 3,000,000 bases of DNA ) was comprised of “ single nucleotide polymorphisms ” ( SNPs are alterations of the individual bases of DNA ) scattered throughout the genome .
It was thought that some of these DNA alterations may in part explain some of the physical differences that exist between two different , but otherwise normal individuals .
In the summer of 2004 , two groups of scientists working independently ( one led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women ’ s Hospital in Boston and the other led by researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories ) called this scientific dogma into question .
Their research identified hundreds of regions of the human genome where the number of copies of a particular DNA segment varied from individual to individual .
With only a few exceptions , all DNA segments were thought to exist in two copies ( one copy inherited from your mother and one copy inherited from your father ) .
Both studies showed that there are hundreds of regions of the genome that could have more or less than the expected two copies .
This alerted scientists to the existence of a larger source of genetic variation than was previously understood , and forced us to speculate on the implications of this discovery .
This discovery was made recently because until now , the technology was not available to comprehensively assess genomic imbalances in a genome ##AT##-##AT## wide fashion .
That has changed over the last five or six years , with the development of a technique known as “ array ##AT##-##AT## based comparative genomic hybridization ” ( array ##AT##-##AT## CGH ) , revolutionizing genetic research and diagnostics .
About three years ago at Brigham and Women ’ s Hospital , when we were seeking a potential tool for high ##AT##-##AT## resolution diagnostics , array ##AT##-##AT## CGH offered the hope of providing a reliable and efficient genome ##AT##-##AT## wide test that could detect gains or losses in an unbiased and non ##AT##-##AT## subjective fashion .
When validation experiments were performed that compared the DNA from one “ normal , healthy ” individual with the DNA from another “ normal , healthy ” individual , we were astonished to find an average of 12 DNA fragments that showed copy number differences between the two individuals being compared .
These became known as copy number variants , or CNVs .
Combining the data from our study and the study from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories , over 300 regions of the genome were found to exhibit CNVs among normal individuals .
Since these two initial studies , many other groups , including ours , have confirmed and documented many more CNVs in other individuals studied .
This is the goal of the Structural Genomic Variation Consortium ’ s Copy Number Variation Project , which aims at providing researchers the most comprehensive list and characterization of CNVs in humans .
The Consortium recently assessed 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Africa , Asia or Europe ( known as the HapMap collection ) to construct a new map of the human genome .
Using two complementary genome ##AT##-##AT## wide technologies , with subsequent validation studies , a total of 1,447 CNVs were identified .
The data clearly demonstrate that individuals are not as genetically similar as once thought .
Many of the regions in which the CNVs were identified overlapped known disease genes .
Since they are being identified in normal individuals , CNVs may not necessarily be a direct cause of human disease , but many may confer susceptibility to certain diseases , serve as disease markers , and / or indicate potential regions of genomic instability .
Some CNVs are also associated with genes involved in immune response and detoxification ##AT##-##AT## related metabolism ( some of the human body ’ s reactions to the environment that we live in ) .
Indeed , some CNVs may turn out to explain why some people react differently to specific medications .
Hopefully , a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic variation ( i.e. single base pair changes and structural genomic variation , such as CNVs ) will ultimately help physicians to prescribe medication in a more individualized manner , that would result in maximum therapeutic effects to each patient , with minimal side effects .
Overall , we anticipate that many of these CNVs will provide explanations to how we adapt and interact with our ever ##AT##-##AT## changing environment .
Indeed , as studies continue to identify and characterize CNVs , we anticipate achieving a better understanding of the relationship between these genetic variations , complex diseases , and human adaptability .
Just as familiarity breeds contempt , success often spawns complacency .
Sadly , that seems to be the case in Russia , where the government has chosen the first period of prolonged economic growth since communism &apos;s fall--with the budget in surplus and capital flight seemingly reversed--to re ##AT##-##AT## open the oligarch wars of the 1990 &apos;s .
Optimists beware : the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky--and the freezing of his shares in oil giant Yukos--will have a profound long ##AT##-##AT## term impact on Russia &apos;s economy and on relations between business and government .
The Yukos imbroglio will not bring Russia &apos;s economy to a screeching halt , because no single company determines the country &apos;s fate . But long ##AT##-##AT## term prospects are certain to deteriorate .
The problem is one of trust between the business community and the government , which in recent years had just begun to develop .
To put it bluntly , violating that fledgling trust will break the back of Russia &apos;s economic upswing .
&quot; Operation Clean Hands &quot; --what some are calling the investigations into Khodorkovsky and his associates--will not increase tax revenue , but only spur growth in the informal economy , as businessmen try to conceal their affairs even more completely from the government .
After all , once Russia &apos;s richest man can be stripped of his assets at any moment , ordinary Russian businessmen may be forgiven for concluding that operating in the open is risky .
The first signs of this realization will probably take the form of an increase in capital flight .
Until the Yukos affair , capital flight was reversing .
After a decade of hemorrhaging capital , the first half of this year saw data indicating that Russians who had taken their money out of the country were bringing it back to invest at home .
If capital flight resumes , it will quickly snowball if President Putin fails to convince people that the Yukos affair is an isolated case .
I believe that capital flight will increase substantially .
Reduced business activity , with long ##AT##-##AT## term investment projects being cancelled , seems just as certain .
A lower rate of economic growth thus seems inevitable .
Nor am I alone .
Independent Russian economic experts are unanimous in sharing this grim conclusion .
Only people linked to the regime appear to differ .
If investment stalls , President Putin will have no hope of doubling the size of the economy within a decade , as he has promised .
My longstanding skepticism about this promise has now hardened into certainty : the Yukos affair will make it impossible to sustain the growth rate required to achieve this goal because the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the seizure of his assets has dealt a devastating blow to business confidence .
Indeed , times have changed dramatically since the cutthroat Russian capitalism of the 1990 &apos;s--supposedly a world in which entrepreneurs were indifferent , at best , to each other &apos;s problems .
That caricature , if ever true , is certainly not true today : the business community &apos;s negative reaction to the persecution of Khodorkovsky by the law enforcement agencies has been strong and nearly unanimous .
The growing calls of some state officials to deal with economic crime are viewed by the business community as both a mockery of the legal code and a veiled threat that the prosecutors want their cut of Russia &apos;s riches .
The improved image of Russia &apos;s legal system is in tatters .
Today , the business community understands that the Prosecutor General &apos;s Office can find any pretext to go after any one of them .
If prosecutors can treat huge businesses so roughly , what hope is there for medium and small businesses ?
No surprise , then , that owners of companies of all sizes are now forming a united front to protect their interests .
President Putin , meanwhile , steadfastly refuses to discuss the Yukos affair or the actions of the law enforcement agencies with Russia &apos;s business community .
His silence clearly implies consent to the actions of the prosecutors .
But if the president will not publicly account for the fidelity of Russia &apos;s law enforcement agencies to law , who will ?
One of the great flaws of Putin &apos;s presidency has been to allow law enforcement agencies to evaluate their own actions .
Of course , they invariably conclude that their actions were right and lawful .
So the president &apos;s position is clear and he will not back down .
In fact , only businesspeople may now be able to influence events : a sharp and pronounced slowdown , with Russian capital showing its displeasure by voting with its feet , might be the last hope for turning the prosecutors from their chosen course .
But I see no reason for optimism .
On the contrary , the arrest of Khodorkovsky has only whetted the prosecutors &apos; appetite .
Once they have digested Yukos , they will look for another meal .
After that , can anyone seriously doubt that the craving for fresh prey will intensify ?
As China &apos;s new leadership team emerges , the world &apos;s attention has focused on President Jiang Zemin &apos;s successor .
But this is misguided , for perhaps the most significant moment in China &apos;s recent history of boom and transformation was the 1998 appointment of Zhu Rongji ( pronounced &quot; Joo Rong ##AT##-##AT## jee &quot; ) as premier of the State Council , a position once held by Deng Xiaoping .
Given the obvious importance of the post in recent years , the choice of Mr. Zhu &apos;s replacement may be of even more significance than President Jiang &apos;s departure from center stage .
Even before he became premier , Mr. Zhu , as the president of China &apos;s central bank , was known as the architect of China &apos;s 8 % annual economic growth in the 1990s and the mastermind of its successful fight against inflation .
Mr. Zhu has been China &apos;s Jack Welch , the tough ##AT##-##AT## minded , longtime CEO of the American conglomerate General Electric--a man celebrated for his candor , his global sophistication , and his insistence on performance .
Indeed , Mr. Zhu was renowned for punishing those who fell short of his expectations .
As mayor of Shanghai , he once disciplined his tourist bureau officials by making them scrub the city &apos;s public toilets themselves .
A few months after his appointment as premier , Mr. Zhu delivered his &quot; three promises &quot; speech , in which he pledged to make three bold moves to secure a more vibrant , self ##AT##-##AT## sustaining economy .
First , he would overhaul the 300,000 state ##AT##-##AT## run national corporations that still conducted an overwhelming amount of China &apos;s business and accounted for the bulk of its economic activity .
More than 70 % of such companies were unprofitable and were propped up by government subsidy .
Just as Mr. Welch promised to &quot; fix , close , or sell &quot; nonperforming divisions of General Electric when he took over the company , Mr. Zhu threatened to fire chief executives of Chinese firms that lost money for more than two consecutive years , and then either to shut them down or sell them .
This forced national corporations to be privatized and go public or to be overseen by provincial governments , a change that proved to be a major impetus for a sudden decentralization of China &apos;s governance structure--another key legacy of Mr. Zhu &apos;s tenure .
Second , Mr. Zhu said he would wipe out the many bad debts of China &apos;s banks and &quot; international trust companies . &quot;
Many of these had contributed to a softening in China &apos;s economy by routinely lending money to insolvent corporations .
At the time , there were 245 such trust companies , which had such a poor record of repayment that overseas investors were beginning to shun China entirely .
Reforming them would take 10 years , he said .
Third , Mr. Zhu said he would streamline the central government and take on one of China &apos;s most pernicious problems : high ##AT##-##AT## level corruption in government agencies .
He would propose measures including , for example , cutting links between government and organized crime , and making it more difficult for bureaucrats to accept bribes .
Politicians often make bold promises but rarely keep them .
On July 1 , 2001 , at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party , Mr. Zhu assessed his progress .
His appraisal of his record in office is notably accurate , and stands as a convincing testament to the effectiveness of his leadership .
Mr. Zhu told the assembled Communist leadership that he had fulfilled the first promise : many of China &apos;s public corporations had become profitable private entities or had been shut down .
Those that were still operating were given stringent profitability targets , were allowed to choose the people they hired , and were encouraged to raise money on private stock exchanges , which effectively propelled them into the private sector as &quot; red chip &quot; corporations .
As for the second promise , more than 50 heads of financial institutions had at that point been fired ( more followed ) , and reforms had changed the investment climate dramatically .
Instead of fleeing the country , capital was flowing in more rapidly than ever before .
Mr. Zhu &apos;s record concerning his third promise was more mixed .
While the size of the central government fell dramatically , with employment at the State Council halved from 34,000 to 17,000 , corruption continued to fester .
Despite Mr. Zhu &apos;s efforts , opposition from vested interests throughout the government--particularly at the highest levels--impeded reform .
Nonetheless , Zhu Rongji &apos;s reforms created the kind of level playing field and rule of law on which a vibrant capitalist system depends .
That is a political legacy second to none in modern Chinese history .
As the world rooted for former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan in his recent efforts to end the violence in Kenya , many also found themselves wondering whether a weary Annan , or some other global leader , will be battling another fire by the end of this month : this time in Zimbabwe .
Zimbabwe ’ s upcoming elections , scheduled for March 29 , offer both fear and hope to the millions trapped in or trying to escape the country ’ s hellish conditions .
Even official data now put the inflation rate at more than 100,000 % , and the plight of ordinary Zimbabweans grows more desperate by the day .
The elections could bring Zimbabweans a chance to end the long dictatorship of President Robert Mugabe .
But , without supervision , they will be held in an environment that could dash Zimbabweans ’ hopes .
Zimbabweans are denied their basic freedoms and subjected to violence .
Torture is widespread .
Civil society groups report the arrests of opposition electoral candidates , the manipulation of food supplies for political purposes , and violent incidents of voter intimidation .
The Zimbabwe Election Support Network has also expressed concern about the country ’ s state of readiness for this complex election , which will combine presidential , parliamentary , senatorial , and local government contests .
And this is to say nothing of the structural faults that continue to impede political progress – a defective constitution , censored media , and a partisan security and military establishment .
It didn ’ t have to be this way .
This past year has seen one missed opportunity after another .
South African president Thabo Mbeki convened negotiations with Zimbabwe ’ s political groups ; but they have been so unfruitful that opposition leaders recently all but accused Mbeki of lying to the world about the progress of the talks .
Some African leaders – notably Ghana ’ s president , John Kufuor , and outgoing African Union head Alpha Konare – have tried to cajole Mugabe towards reform , to no avail .
Perhaps more significantly , the international community ’ s failure to address Zimbabwe seriously shows , once again , that it lacks the political will to prevent foreseeable crises .
Last year , UN Secretary General Ban Ki ##AT##-##AT## moon and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour condemned the regime ’ s use of torture and its mistreatment of pro ##AT##-##AT## democracy forces .
Regrettably , the UN failed to follow up with institutional action .
The UN would say it must be invited into a country before it can take certain forms of action , such as sending official election observers .
But it is also true that with adequate political will , the UN Security Council could live up to its responsibility to Zimbabweans by responding to the crisis more aggressively .
The UN should have put Mugabe on the defensive with a forceful public offer to help Zimbabwe prepare for internationally supervised elections .
Instead , the UN continues to defer to Mugabe , who hides behind claims of sovereignty while jailing a defenseless populace .
With so many lives at stake , what can be done to avert an intensification of the Zimbabwe crisis ?
People of good will throughout the world , including those affiliated with multilateral organizations like the UN , should descend on Zimbabwe to observe this month ’ s elections .
Accredited or not , they should stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe at this crucial moment , act as witnesses to the deteriorating pre ##AT##-##AT## election environment , and serve as a bulwark against any escalation of state brutality during and after the vote .
Mugabe would prefer to limit the presence of international observers to those sent by neighboring states – the same allies that somehow managed to deem the violent and fraudulent elections of the past seven years “ legitimate . ”
Zimbabwe ’ s neighbors also face a choice : they can use their proximity to halt Mugabe ’ s abuses , or to shield him from international scrutiny and rebuke .
Their choice may depend on what the world demands of them .
The people of Zimbabwe will play their part on March 29 .
As for the regional and world community , their actions today and in the coming weeks could make the difference between a reprise of the violence in Kenya and the first step towards a more stable and democratic future .
Habeas corpus , Latin for “ you have the body , ” is an old English common law principle incorporated into the US Constitution to ensure freedom from unlawful detention by the state .
It was and continues to be a critical check against the imprisonment of individuals without oversight by independent courts .
In Zimbabwe , this right – like so many other checks and balances – has been torn away by a repressive state .
Just hours before the US Supreme Court ruling , Tendai Biti , the Secretary ##AT##-##AT## General of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , was arrested upon his return to Zimbabwe .
Despite immediate attempts by his lawyers to locate him , his whereabouts remained unknown for days .
The police dismissed an initial court order demanding that Biti be produced before the court .
After Biti was finally produced before the court days later , the government announced that he will be charged with treason – which carries the death penalty – for unofficially announcing the results of the March 29 , 2008 , elections . Prior to his detention , Biti had responded to such allegations by stating that his only crime was to fight for democracy in Zimbabwe .
It is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his detention in an independent court .
Since 1999 , the MDC has offered a democratic alternative to President Robert Mugabe ’ s regime .
In the most recent elections , Zimbabweans made their choice known , despite serious obstacles and widespread repression , with the MDC ’ s presidential candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , gaining more votes than Mugabe .
But , according to the vote counts released by the government after a suspicious month ##AT##-##AT## long delay , the MDC ’ s margin of victory – 48 % to 43 % – fell short of the 50 % required to avoid a run ##AT##-##AT## off election .
Biti is not the only MDC member to be “ disappeared ” for a period of time by Mugabe ’ s government .
Over the past two years , police and government ##AT##-##AT## supported paramilitaries have routinely jailed , beaten , and even killed MDC officials and suspected MDC members .
Last year , Biti was detained and beaten along with Tsvangirai and dozens of other MDC officials .
The photos of Tsvangirai ’ s pummeled body led to an international outcry .
State ##AT##-##AT## sponsored violence against the MDC and its supporters has escalated as the June 27 run ##AT##-##AT## off vote draws near . Just weeks ago , Biti described the discovery of the mutilated body of Tonderai Ndira , an MDC youth leader .
Ndira had been taken by the police from his home .
He was missing for seven days ; when his body was found , it was recognizable only by a bracelet he always wore .
Here in our offices in Johannesburg , we have two Zimbabwean lawyers who fled their country after receiving death threats for their work defending human rights .
At least five of their clients have been murdered in the past few weeks .
Most recently , the Zimbabwean police suspended the work of numerous human rights organizations that were documenting the recent violence .
It is hard to imagine that a free and fair election can take place against the backdrop of such intense and systemic violence .
Indeed , even South African president Thabo Mbeki , who , despite an outcry from many of his citizens , has supported Mugabe , felt compelled to label it a “ cause for serious concern . ”
In the majority opinion in Boumediene v. Bush , Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that “ Liberty and security can be reconciled ; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law . ” But there is no rule of law left in Zimbabwe – no habeas corpus and no check on arbitrary state action .
It is time for the international community to step in , call for an end to the detention and disappearance of MDC officials and perceived supporters , and push for a democratic transition in Zimbabwe .
Only then can the principles underlying the Supreme Court ’ s decision come within reach of ordinary Zimbabweans .
JOHANNESBURG – Morgan Tsvangirai ’ s withdrawal from the presidential run ##AT##-##AT## off scheduled for June 27 , and his decision to seek the protection of the Dutch embassy in Pretoria , has secured for Zimbabwe ’ s President Robert Mugabe a Pyrrhic victory .
Mugabe ’ s triumph comes at a huge cost to democracy and stability in Zimbabwe , as well as in the region .
The actions of the Mugabe regime in the run ##AT##-##AT## up to Tsvangirai ’ s decision demand a strong regional response to what is clearly a stolen victory . Indeed , Mugabe ’ s continuing in power represents the most serious challenge to Africa ’ s nascent democratic institutions and to South Africa ’ s vision of a continent of peace and prosperity .
After contesting every election since 2000 , Tsvangirai ’ s Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) has changed tactics reluctantly .
Under the circumstances , South Africa and the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) urgently need to reappraise their approach not only to Mugabe , but to how they will deal with any uncontested election .
A host of declarations adopted over the years by the SADC and the African Union address the conduct of elections on the continent .
These include the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections ( 2004 ) , the African Charter on Democracy , Elections , and Governance ( 2007 ) , and the Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa ( 2002 ) .
None of these principles have been respected in Zimbabwe , and regional leaders have not cited their violation as reason to censure Mugabe ’ s government .
Unfortunately , we have a recent precedent for this type of behavior : Kenya ’ s rulers , too , ignored and twisted the rule of law and the integrity of the electoral process , relying on violence to secure a political outcome that their fellow citizens denied them .
Dealing effectively with political instability in Africa requires two things : the political will of key states to underwrite the democratic process , and strong regional institutions to provide a legal framework reflecting the principles underpinning states ’ behavior . The effectiveness of regional institutions and the role of regional powers are interlinked .
Regional institutions can entrench themselves only if their members promote adherence to the spirit and letter of their legal frameworks .
In both cases , South Africa – the main regional power with the most levers of influence over Zimbabwe – has a vital role to play .
But does South Africa really see itself as a regional power ?
Its handling of Mugabe over the past eight years has actually underplayed its leverage .
Yet the mantle of a regional power sometimes requires using that leverage for the greater good of the region .
What should South Africa do now ?
Should President Thabo Mbeki step down as mediator in the Zimbabwe crisis , not because he has failed , but to remove from South Africa the constraints that being a mediator put in place ?
South Africa has a vested interest in stability , and it can turn the screws on Mugabe ’ s regime , much as it has refused to contemplate any form of sanctions because of their impact on the poor .
South Africa must tap into the growing concern among Zimbabwe ’ s neighbors ( Angola , Botswana , Tanzania , and Zambia ) about the political crisis , and forge a united front within the SADC that sends a clear message to Mugabe and his generals that the region will no longer tolerate their actions .
The SADC should not endorse the regime ’ s claim of victory in an uncontested election .
It must insist that all opposition leaders and supporters be freed immediately , and that all state ##AT##-##AT## sponsored violence be halted .
It should dispatch an eminent persons ’ group of senior African and other international leaders to Zimbabwe , as well as peace monitors to ensure that the government complies with these demands .
The SADC ’ s censure of Mugabe and his regime should be backed up by concrete actions , such as restrictions on all arms flows to Zimbabwe , travel restrictions on senior officials of Zimbabwe ’ s ruling ZANU ##AT##-##AT## PF party , and the threat of property seizures and the freezing of financial assets in the region and beyond .
Mbeki and other SADC leaders should recognize a key point . According to legal opinions commissioned by the Southern African Litigation Center , Zimbabwe ’ s Electoral Act holds that the delay or absence of a lawful run ##AT##-##AT## off means that the candidate who obtained the most votes in the election of March 29 , 2008 , has been duly elected as President .
Moreover , South Africa was instrumental in drafting the declaration on unconstitutional changes of government , adopted by the Organization of African Unity , the AU ’ s predecessor , in 1999 .
The manner in which the electoral process in Zimbabwe has been conducted since March has been an unconstitutional continuation of government .
The declaration clearly stipulates that an incumbent government ’ s refusal to relinquish power to the winning party after free , fair , and regular elections is unconstitutional .
If South Africa sees itself as speaking for Africa on the global stage and creating a vision for the continent ’ s future , it must know when to lead and how to build consensus .
None of this is easy , but South Africa must now act decisively in order to polish its tarnished image as a responsible regional power . “ Business as usual ” is no longer a viable approach for South African foreign policy .
Will newly anointed World Bank President Robert Zoellick be able to get the organization back on its feet after the catastrophic failed presidency of Paul Wolfowitz ?
Although hardly a megawatt star of the Bob Rubin category , he certainly brings some positive attributes to the job .
First , as a key player in bringing China into the World Trade Organization , Zoellick is a proven internationalist in an American administration where internationalists have sometimes seemed like an endangered species .
Second , he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade , which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half ##AT##-##AT## century than any aid program .
Third , he seems to have been a consistent behind ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## scenes supporter of the Bank , whereas many of his Bush administration colleagues would be just as happy to see it shut down and its Washington headquarters turned into private condominiums and offices .
So presumably he has a constructive vision for the Bank ’ s future .
But Zoellick is not without his weaknesses .
First and foremost , his appointment extends the embarrassingly outmoded practice of always installing an American in the job .
With the Bank tirelessly preaching the merits of good governance , its failure to adopt democratic principles undercuts its own legitimacy .
The claim that the World Bank needs an American president to ensure that the US keeps donating money is ridiculous .
The annual cost of the US contribution to the World Bank , even taking into account off ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## books loan guarantees , is relatively minor .
Any number of developing countries , from China to India to Brazil , could easily step up if the US foolishly stepped down .
Zoellick ’ s background as a lawyer hardly makes him perfect for the job , either .
The World Bank presidency is not about negotiating treaties , as Zoellick did when he was US Trade Representative .
The Bank ’ s most important role in development today is as a “ knowledge bank ” that helps aggregate , distill , and disseminate best practices from around the world .
In this respect , the Bank ’ s technical assistance to governments is very similar to what private consultants offer to companies .
Moreover , many of the World Bank president ’ s most important decisions involve economics in an essential way .
Wrong economic decisions , such as in the 1970 ’ s , when Robert McNamara pushed grandiose , but environmentally devastating , infrastructure projects , have haunted the Bank for decades .
The biggest question mark , though , is whether Zoellick will be able to hit the ground running and implement desperately needed reforms .
Reform number one , of course , is to ensure that the next World Bank President is not an American .
Rodrigo de Rato , Zoellick ’ s counterpart at the European ##AT##-##AT## dominated International Monetary Fund , has already suggested that his successor should be chosen in a more inclusive process .
The World Bank should be ashamed that its president has not yet offered a similar proposal .
Second , Zoellick should ask why the Bank spends only 2.5 % of its budget on the “ knowledge bank ” research function that it trumpets so proudly in its external relations materials , while it spends three times that amount on maintaining its executive board .
Third , Zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of World Bank aid .
The idea that a big government ##AT##-##AT## guaranteed global bank is needed to fill holes in private capital markets is laughable nowadays .
True , the Bank ’ s poorest clients have little access to private capital markets . By and large , however , the poorest countries need grants , not loans that they still won ’ t be able to pay in 20 years .
As the Bank switches from loans to grants , it can use some of its massive retained earnings to endow its “ knowledge bank ” function and related technical advice .
But all this knowledge shouldn ’ t be free .
A lot of technical advice falls on deaf ears , with countries listening only long enough to get their hands on Bank money .
Instead of merely pushing its agenda , the Bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its engagements are client ##AT##-##AT## driven .
Last but not least , the Bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and , in general , in promoting good international citizenship by both rich and poor countries .
( Some of us have been proposing this for almost two decades . )
Of course , Zoellick could just attempt to fill the role symbolically and do little or nothing , as some of his predecessors have done .
Or , less likely , he could embrace some megalomaniacal and over ##AT##-##AT## reaching vision of government intervention , as others have tried .
In any case , let ’ s wish him luck .
The world needs the World Bank a lot more than it needs another condominium .
The anxiety over Jacob Zuma ’ s election as president of South Africa obscures a significant milestone : for the first time in decades , a sub ##AT##-##AT## Saharan nation has at its helm a champion of ordinary people .
African politics has long been the exclusive domain of aristocrats , soldiers , and technocrats .
Even with the spread of democratic elections , the region ’ s leaders tend to come from the ranks of soldiers ( Uganda , Rwanda , Zimbabwe ) , family dynasties ( Togo , Kenya , etc ) , or university professors , lawyers , and economists ( Ghana , Malawi , Liberia ) .
Now South Africa , the region ’ s economic engine and home to its most sophisticated universities , media , and corporations , has a former goat herder at its helm , a rare African leader with the common touch .
Zuma is legendary for his ability to connect with ordinary people .
He ’ s secure enough to dance and sing in public . He speaks the language of populism , raising hopes for the vast majority of South Africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing , schools , and health care .
Until now , populism has been the missing note in African political culture .
Zuma , who spent his youth herding cattle and only gained formal education while in the notorious Robben Island prison with Mandela , is refreshingly aware that Africa ’ s biggest problem is its inequalities , not its global marginalization . In Africa ’ s wealthiest nation – but also the nation where wealth is most unequally shared – a bold populist now holds ultimate power over government policy .
Yet , while Zuma ’ s populist appeal reflects South Africa ’ s especially large differences in economic class , the threat of imposing higher taxes and other obligations on employers and the wealthy has raised fears at home and internationally .
Moreover , Zuma has been called a chameleon , accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear .
Zuma ’ s turbulent personal life – many wives and his embarrassing contention during a rape trial that he avoided HIV infection by taking a shower – has invited ridicule .
Most seriously , doubts persist about his commitment to democracy , with critics arguing he ’ s an old ##AT##-##AT## style African “ big man ” ready to bully opponents and ravage the public coffers with his cronies .
Dismissing complaints , Zuma insists , “ There ’ s no cloud around me . ”
His defenders , meanwhile , point to two benefits that he has already delivered : an end to Mbeki ’ s ambivalent approach to fighting HIV / AIDS , the country ’ s major public health threat , and a refreshing willingness to move against Zimbabwe ’ s aged dictator , Robert Mugabe , whom Mbeki coddled out of a misguided sense of loyalty for his support during the struggle against apartheid .
In an Africa bereft of successful populist politicians , Zuma ’ s role models may come from Latin America , where income inequality is also extreme and the trade ##AT##-##AT## union movement , as in South Africa , is strong and militant .
With enormous pressure from ordinary people to deliver tangible gains , Zuma the populist will quickly face a major test : will he emulate Lula of Brazil , who has struck an admirable balance between good economic governance and re ##AT##-##AT## distribution of wealth to the poor ?
Or will he follow the path of Hugo Chávez , a popular autocrat who seems to prefer building a cult of personality over raising living standards for the poor .
The stakes for Africa are enormous .
South Africa has the continent ’ s largest economy and , until the global financial crisis , posted 10 years of steady economic growth .
In an economic slowdown , the country ’ s severe crime problem might only worsen ; so might unemployment , which already tops 20 % in the formal economy .
Zuma senses the urgency of the situation .
He is , after all , 67 years old and likely to serve only a single term in office . “ We can ’ t waste time , ” he says .
Yet , according to the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki , at his core , “ Zuma is a conservative . ” In this sense , Zuma represents yesterday ’ s South Africa .
He is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid – and then peacefully engineered a transition to durable black ##AT##-##AT## majority rule .
Their achievement remains one of the greatest in recent history .
At the same time , Zuma ’ s revolutionary generation still seems uneasy leading South Africa in a post ##AT##-##AT## apartheid era that is now 15 years old .
In a region that reveres the elderly , Zuma ’ s attachment to his rural traditions must be matched by an equal openness to the appetites of the country ’ s youth .
Three in ten South Africans are younger than 15 , meaning that they did not live a day under apartheid .
Somehow Zuma must find a way to honor his own generation ’ s commitment to racial justice and national liberation , while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and yearn for material gain .
